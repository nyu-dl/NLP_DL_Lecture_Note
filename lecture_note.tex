\chapter{Introduction}

This lecture is going to be the only one where I discuss some philosophical,
meaning nonpractical, arguments, because accoring to Chris Manning and Hinrich
Schuetze, ``{\it even practically-minded people have to confront the issue of
what prior knowledge to try to build into their model}''
\cite{manning1999foundations}. 

\section{Route we will {\it not} take}
\label{sec:wrong_route}

\subsection{What is Language?}

The very first question we must ask ourselves before starting this course is the
question of what natural language is. Of course, the rest of this course does
not in any way require us to know what natural language is, but it is a
philosophical question I recommend everyone, including myself, to ponder upon
once a while. 

When I start talking about languages with anyone, there is a single person who
never misses to be mentioned, that is Noam Chomsky. His view has greatly
influenced the modern linguistics, and although many linguists I have talked to
claim that their work and field have long moved on from Chomsky's, I can feel
his shadow all over them. 

My first encounter with Chomsky was at the classroom of $<$Automata$>$ from my
early undergrad years. I was not the most attentive student back then, and all I
can remember is Chomsky's hierarchy and how it has shaped our view on languages,
in this context, programming/computer languages.  A large part of the course was
dedicated to explaining which class of languages emerges given a set of
constraints on a set of {\it generating rules}, or production rules. 

For instance, if we are given a set of generating rules that do not depend on
the context/meaning of non-terminal symbols (context-free grammar, CFG), we get
a context-free language. If we put a bit of constraints to CFG that each
generating rule is such that a non-terminal symbol is replaced by either a
terminal symbol, a terminal symbol by a non-terminal symbol or an empty symbol,
then we get a regular grammar. Similarly to CFG, we get a regular language from
the regular grammar, and the regular language is a subset of the context-free
language.

What Chomsky believes is that this kind of approach applies also to human
languages, or natural languages. There exists a set of generating rules that
{\it generates} a natural language. But, then, the obvious question to follow is
where those generating rules are. Where are they stored? How are they stored? Do
we have separate generating rules for different languages? 

\subsection{Language Understanding}
\label{sec:language_understanding_wrong}

\paragraph{Understanding Human Language}

Those questions are interesting, but out of scope for this course. Those
questions are the ones linguists try to answer. Generative linguistics aims at
figuring out what those rules are, how they are combined to form a valid
sentence, how they are adapted to different languages and so on. We will leave
these to linguists and continue on to our journey of {\it building a machine
that understands human languages}. 

\paragraph{Natural Language Understanding}

So, let's put these questions aside and trust Chomsky that we, humans, are
specially designed to store those generating rules somewhere in the brain
\cite{chomsky1959review,carnie2013syntax}. Or, better yet, let's trust Chomsky
that there's a universal grammar {\it built in} our brain. In other words, let's
say we were born with this set of generating rules for natural languages, and
while growing, we have adapted this universal grammar toward our native tongue
(language variation).

When we decide to speak of something (whatever that is and however implausible
that is), our brain quickly picks up a sequence of some of those generating
rules and starts generating a sentence accordingly. Of course, those rules do
not generate a sentence directly, but generates a sequence of control signals to
move our muscles to make sound. When heard by other people who understand your
language, the sound becomes a sentence.

In our case, we are more interested in a {\it machine} hearing that sound, or a
sentence from here on. When a machine heard this sentence, what would/should a
{\it language understanding machine} do to understand a language, or more simply
a sentence? Again, we are assuming that this sentence was generated from
applying a sequence of the existing generating rules. 

Under our assumption, a natural first step that comes to my mind is to figure
out that sequence of the generating rules which led to the sentence. Once the
sequence is found, or in a fancier term, inferred, the next step will be to
figure out what kind of mental state of the speaker led to those generating
rules. 

Let's take an example sentence ``{\it Our company is training workers}'' (from
Sec. 1.3 of \cite{manning1999foundations}), which is a horrible choice, because
this was used as an example of ambiguity in parsing. Regardless, a speaker
obviously has an awesome image of her company which trains its workers and wants
to tell a machine about this. This mental state is used to select the following
generating rules (assuming a phrase structure grammar)\footnote{
    Stanford Parser: \url{http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser}
}:
\begin{verbatim}
    (ROOT
      (S
          (NP (PRP$ Our) (NN company))
              (VP (VBZ is)
                    (VP (VBG training)
                            (NP (NNS workers))))))
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/manning_parse.pdf}
    \caption{A parse of ``{\it Our company is training workers}''}
    \label{fig:manning_parse}
\end{figure}

The machine hears the sentence ``{\it Our company is training workers}'' and
infers the parse in Fig.~\ref{fig:manning_parse}. Then, we can make a simple set
of rules (again!) to let the machine answer questions about this sentence, kinds
of questions that imply that the machine has understood the sentence (language).
For instance, given a question ``{\it Who is training workers?}'', the machine
can answer by noticing that the question is asking for the subject of the verb
phrase
``{\it is training}'' acted on the object ``{\it workers}'' and that the subject
is ``{\it Our company}''.

\paragraph{Side Note: Bayesian Language Understanding} This generative view of
languages fits quite well with Bayesian modelling (see, e.g.,
\cite{perfors2006poverty}.) There exists a hidden mechanism, or a set of
generating rules and a rule governing their composition, which can be modelled
as a latent variable $Z$.  Given these rules, a language or a sentence $X$ is
generated according to the conditional distribution $P(X|Z)$. Then,
understanding language (by humans) is equivalent to computing the posterior
distribution over all possible sets of generating rules and their compositional
rules (i.e., $P(Z|X)$.) This answers the question of what is the most likely
mechanism underlying the observed language.

Furthermore, from the perspective of machines, Bayesian approach is attractive.
In this case, we assume to know {\it the} set of rules in advance and let the
latent variable $Z$ denote the specific configuration (use) of those rules.
Given this sequence of applying the rules, a sentence $X$ is generated via the
conditional distribution $P(X|Z)$. Machine understanding of language is
equivalent to inferring the posterior distribution over $Z$ given $X$.

For more details about Bayesian approaches (in the context of machine learning),
please, refer to \cite{bishop2006pattern} or take the course DS-GA 1005
Inference and Representation by Prof. David Sontag.

\paragraph{Understanding vs. Using} 
What's clear from this example is that in this generative view of languages,
there is a clear separation between understanding and using. Inferring the
generating rules from a given sentence is {\it understanding}, and answering a
question based on this understanding, {\it using}, is a separate activity.
Understanding part is done when the underlying (true) structure has been
determined regardless of how this understanding be used.

To put it in a slightly different wording, language understanding does not
require its use, or downstream tasks. In this road that we will {\em not} take
in this course, understanding exists as it is, regardless of what the understood
insight/knowledge will be used for. And, this is the reason why we do not walk
down this road.

\section{Road we {\it will} take}

\subsection{Language as a Function}

In this course, we will view a natural/human language as ``{\it a system
intended to communicate ideas from a speaker to a hearer}''
\cite{winograd1972understanding}. What this means is that we do not view a
language as a separate entity that exists on its own. Rather, we view a whole
system or behaviour of {\it communication} as a language. Furthermore, this view
dictates that we must take into account the world surrounding a speaker and a
hearer in order to understand language.

Under this view of language, language or rather its usage become somewhat
similar to action or behaviour. Speaking of something is equivalent to acting on
a listener, as both of them influence the listener in one way or another. The
purpose of language is then to influence another by efficiently communicate
one's will or intention.\footnote{
    Chomsky does not agree: ``{\it it is wrong to think of human use of language
    as characteristically informative, in fact or in intention.}''
    \cite{chomsky1968linguistic}.
} This hints at how language came to be (or may have come to be): (evolution)
language has evolved to facilitate the exchange of ideas among people (learning)
humans learn language by being either encouraged or punished for the use of
language. This latter view on how language came to be is similar in spirit to
the behaviourism of B. F. Skinner (``{\it necessary mediation of reinforcement by
another organism}'' \cite{skinner2014verbal}.)

This is a radical departure from the generative view of human language, where
language existed on its own and its understanding does not necessarily require
the existence of the outside world nor the existence of a listener. It is no
wonder why Chomsky was so harsh in criticizing Skinner's work in
\cite{chomsky1959review}. 
This departure, as I see it, is the departure toward a functional view of
language. {\it Language is a function of communication}. 

\subsection{Language Understanding as a Function Approximation}

Let's make a large jump here such that we consider this function as a
mathematical function.  This function (called language) takes as input the state
of the surrounding world, the speaker's speech, either written, spoken or signed
and the listener's mental state\footnote{
    We assume here that a such thing exists however it is represented in
    our brain.
} Inside the function, the listener's mental state is updated to incorporate the
new idea from the speaker's speech. The function then returns a response by the
listener (which may include ``no response'' as well) and a set of non-verbal
action sequences (what would be the action sequence if the speaker insulted
the listener?).

In this case, language understanding, both from humans' and machines'
perspective, boils down to figuring out the internal working of this function.
In other words, we understand language by learning the internal mechanism of the
function.  Furthermore, this view suggests that the underlying structures of
language are heavily dependent on the surrounding environment (context) as well
as on the target task. The former (context dependence) is quite clear, as the
function takes as input the context, but the latter may be confusing now.
Hopefully, this will become clearer later in the course.

How can we approximate this function? How can we figure out the internal working
mechanism of this function? What tools do we have?

\paragraph{Language Understanding by Machine Learning}
This functional view of languages suddenly makes machine learning a very
appealing tool for understanding human languages. After all, function
approximation is {\em the} core of machine learning. Classification is a
classical example of function approximation, clustering is a function
approximation where the target is not given, generative modeling learns a
function that returns a probability of an input, and so on.

When we approximate a function in machine learning, the prime ingredient is
data. We are given data which was either generated from this function
(unsupervised learning) or well fit this function (supervised learning), based
on which we adjust our approximation to the function, often iteratively, to best
fit the data. But, I must note here that it does not matter how well the approximated
function fits the data it was fitted to, but matters how well this approximation fits
{\em unseen} data.\footnote{
    This is a matter of generalization, and we will talk
    about this more throughout the course.
}

In language understanding, this means that we collect a large data set of input
and output pairs (or conversations together with the recording of the
surrounding environment) and fit some arbitrary function to well predict the
output given an input. We probably want to evaluate this approximation in a
novel conversation. If this function makes a conversation just like a person,
voil\`{a}, we made a machine that passed the Turing test.  Simple, right?

\paragraph{Problem}
Unfortunately, as soon as we try to do this, we run into a big problem. This
problem is not from machine learning nor languages, but the definition of this
function of language.

Properly approximating this function requires us to either simulate or record
the whole world (in fact, the whole universe.) For, this function takes as input
and maintains as internal state the surrounding world (context) and the mental
state of the individual (speaker.) This is unavoidable, if we wanted to very
well approximate this function as a whole.

It is unclear, however, whether we want to approximate the full function. For a
human to survive, yes, it is likely that the full function is needed. But, if
our goal is restricted to a certain task (such as translation, language
modelling, and so on), we may not want to approximate this function fully. We
probably want to approximate only a subset of this whole function. For instance,
if our goal is to understand the process of translation from one language to
another, we can perhaps ignore all but the speech input to the function and all
but the speech output from the function, because often a (trained) person can
translate a sentence in one language to another without knowing the whole
context.

This latter approach to language understanding--approximating a partial function
of languages-- will be at the core of this course. We will talk about various
language tasks that are a part of this whole function of language. These tasks
will include, but are not limited to, language modelling, machine translation,
image/video description generation and question answering. For these tasks and
potentially more, we will study how to use machine learning, or more
specifically deep learning, to solve these tasks by approximating sub-functions
of language.


\chapter{Function Approximation as Supervised Learning}
\label{chap:function_approx}

Throughout this course, we will extensively use artificial neural
networks\footnote{
    From here on, I will simply drop artificial and call them neural networks.
    Whenever I say ``neural network'', it refers to artificial neural networks.
}
to approximate (a part of) the function of natural language. This makes it
necessary for us to study the basics of neural networks first, and this lecture
and a couple of subsequent ones are designed to serve this purpose.

\section{Function Approximation: Parametric Approach}

\subsection{Expected Cost Function}

Let us start by defining a data distribution $p_{\text{data}}$.
$p_{\text{data}}$ is defined over a pair of input and output vectors, $\vx \in
\II^d$ and $\vy \in \OO^k$, respectively. $\II$ and $\OO$ are respectively sets
of all possible input and output values, such as $\RR$, $\left\{ 0, 1\right\}$
and $\left\{0, 1, \ldots, L\right\}$. This data distribution is not known to us.

The goal is to find a relationship between $\vx$ and $\vy$. More specifically,
we are interested in finding a function $f:\RR^d \to \OO^k$ that generates the
output $\vy$ given its corresponding input $\vx$. The very first thing we should
do is to put some constraints on the function $f$ to make our search for the
correct $f$ a bit less impossible. In this lecture, and throughout the course, I
will consider only a parametric function $f$, in which case the function is
fully specified with a set of parameters $\TT$.

Next, we must define a way to measure how well the function $f$ approximates the
underlying mechanism of generation ($\vx \to \vy$). Let's denote by $\hat{\vy}$ the 
output of the function with a particular set $\TT$ of parameters and a given input
$\vx$:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\vy} = f_{\TT}(\vx)
\end{align*}
How well $f$ approximates the true generating function is equivalent to how far
$\hat{\vy}$ is from the correct output $\vy$. Let's use $D(\hat{\vy}, \vy)$ for
now call this distance\footnote{
    Note that we do not require this distance to satisfy the triangular
    inequality, meaning that it does not have to be a distance. However, I will
    just call it distance for now.
}
between $\hat{\vy}$ and $\vy$

It is clear that we want to find $\TT$ that minimizes $D(\hat{\vy}, \vy)$ for
every pair in the space ($RR^d \times \OO^k$). But, wait, every pair equally
likely? Probably not, for we do not care how well $f_{\TT}$ approximates the
true function, when a pair of input $\vx$ and output $\vy$ is unlikely, meaning
we do not care how bad the approximation is, if $p_\text{data}(\vx, \vy)$ is
small. However, this is a bit difficult to take into account, as we must decided
on the threshold below which we consider any pair irrelevant.

Hence, we {\em weight} the distance between the approximated $\hat{\vy}$ and the
correct $\vy$ of each pair $(\vx, \vy)$ in the space by its probability $p(\vx,
\vy)$. Mathematically saying, we want to find 
\begin{align*}
    \arg\min_{\TT} \int_{\vx} \int_{\vy} p_{\text{data}}(\vx, \vy) D(\hat{\vy}, \vy) \dd{\vx}
    \dd{\vy},
\end{align*}
where the integral $\int$ should be replaced with the summation $\sum$ if any of
$\vx$ and $\vy$ is discrete.

We call this quantity being minimized with respect to the parameters $\TT$ a
cost function $C(\TT)$. This is equivalent to computing the {\em expected}
distance between the predicted output $\hat{\vy}$ and the correct one $\vy$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:expected_cost}
    C(\TT) =& \int_{\vx} \int_{\vy} p_{\text{data}}(\vx, \vy) D(\hat{\vy}, \vy) \dd{\vx}
    \dd{\vy}, \\
    =& \E_{(\vx,\vy) \sim p_{\text{data}}}\left[ D(\hat{\vy}, \vy) \right] 
\end{align}
This is often called an expected loss or risk, and minimizing this cost function
is referred to as {\em expected risk minimization}~\cite{Vapnik1995}.

Unfortunately $C(\TT)$ cannot be (exactly) computed for a number of reasons. The
most important reason among them is simply that we don't know what the data
distribution $p_{\text{data}}$ is. Even if we have access to $p_{\text{data}}$,
we can exactly compute $C(\TT)$ only with heavy assumptions on both the data
distribution and the distance function.\footnote{Why?} 

\subsection{Empirical Cost Function}

This does not mean that we are doomed from the beginning. Instead of the
full-blown description of the data distribution $p_{\text{data}}$, we will
assume that someone miraculously gave us a finite set of pairs drawn from the
data distribution. We will call this a training set $D$:
\begin{align*}
    D=\left\{ (\vx^1, \vy^1), \ldots, (\vx^N, \vy^N) \right\}.  
\end{align*}

As we have access to the samples from the data distribution, we can use Monte
Carlo method to approximate the expected cost function $C(\TT)$ such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:empirical_cost}
    C(\TT) \approx \tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N D(\hat{\vy^{n}},
    \vy^{n}).
\end{align}
We call this approximate $\tilde{C}(\TT)$ of the expected cost function, an
empirical cost function (or empirical risk or empirical loss.)

Because empirical cost function is readily computable, we will mainly work with
the empirical cost function not with the expected cost function. However, keep
in mind that at the end of the day, the goal is to find a set of parameters that
minimizes the {\em expected} cost.


\section{Learning as Optimization}

We often call this process of finding a good set of parameters that minimizes
the expected cost {\em learning}. This term is used from the perspective of a
machine which implements the function $f_{\TT}$, as it {\em learns} to
approximate the true generating function $f$ from training data.

From what I have described so far, it may have become clear even without me
mentioning that learning is {\em optimization}. We have a clearly defined
function (the empirical cost function $\tilde{C}$) which needs to be minimized
with respect to its input $\TT$.

\subsection{Gradient-based Local Iterative Optimization}
There are many optimization algorithms one can use to find a set of parameters
that minimizes $\tilde{C}$. Sometimes, you can even find the optimal set of
parameters in a closed form equation.\footnote{
    One such example is a linear regression where 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f_{\TT=\left\{ \mW\right\}}(\vx) = \mW \vx$
        \item $D(\hat{\vy}, \vy) = \frac{1}{2} \| \hat{\vy} - \vy \|^2$
    \end{itemize}
    In this case, the optimal $\mW$ is 
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:opt_lin}
        \mW = \mY \mX^\top (\mX \mX^\top)^{-1},
    \end{align}
    where
    \begin{align*}
        \mX = \left[ \vx^1; \ldots ;\vx^N\right], \mY = \left[ \vy^1; \ldots ;\vy^N\right]. 
    \end{align*}

    Try it yourself! 
}
In most cases, because there is no known closed-form solution, it is typical to
use an iterative optimization algorithm (see \cite{Fletcher1987} for in-depth
discussion on optimization.) 

By an {\em iterative} optimization, I mean an algorithm which refines its
estimate of the optimal set of parameters little by little until the values of
the parameters converge to the optimal (expected) cost function. Also, it is
worthwhile to note that most iterative optimization algorithms are {\em local},
in the sense that they do not require us to evaluate the whole parameter space,
but only a small subset along the path from the starting point to the
convergence point.\footnote{
    There are {\em global} optimization algorithms, but they are out of scope
    for this course. See, for instance, \cite{Brochu2010} for one such algorithm
    called Bayesian optimization.
}

Here I will describe the simplest one among those local iterative optimization
algorithms, called gradient descent (GD) algorithm. As the name suggests, this
algorithm depends entirely on the gradient of the cost function.\footnote{
    From here on, I will use the cost function to refer to the {\em empirical}
    cost function.
} 

The gradient of a function $\nabla \tilde{C}$ is a vector whose direction points
to the direction of the greatest rate of increase in the function's value and
whose magnitude measures this rate. At each point $\TT_t$ in the parameter
space, the gradient of the cost function $\nabla \tilde{C}(\TT_t)$ is the {\em
opposite} direction toward which we want to move the parameters. See
Fig.~\ref{fig:grad} for graphical illustration.

        (\textcolor{magenta}{magenta}) a negative gradient at $x=-0.6$.}
        \label{fig:grad}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

One important point of GD that needs to be mentioned here is on how large a step
one takes each time. As clear from the magenta line (the direction opposite to
the direction given by the gradient) in Fig.~\ref{fig:grad}, if too large a step
is taken toward the negative gradient direction, the optimization process will
overshoot and miss the (local) minimum around $x=-0.8$. This step size, or
sometimes called learning rate, $\eta$ is one most important hyperparameter of
the GD algorithm.

Now we have all the ingredients for the GD algorithm: $\nabla \tilde{C}$ and
$\eta$. The GD algorithm iterates the following step:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:GD}
    \TT \leftarrow \TT - \eta \nabla \tilde{C}(\TT).
\end{align}
The iteration continues until a certain stopping criterion is met, which we will
discuss shortly.

\subsection{Stochastic Gradient Descent}
\label{sec:sgd}

This simple GD algorithm works surprisingly quite well, and it is a fundamental
basis upon which many advanced optimization algorithms have been built. I will
present a list of few of those advanced algorithms later on and discuss them
briefly. But, before going into those advanced algorithms, let's solve one tiny,
but significant issue of the GD algorithm.

This tiny, but significant issue arises especially often in machine learning.
That is, it is computationally very expensive to compute $\tilde{C}$ and
consequently its gradient $\nabla \tilde{C}$, thanks to the ever increasing size
of the training set $D$. 

Why is the growing size of the training set making it more and more
computationally demanding to compute $\tilde{C}$ and $\nabla \tilde{C}$?  This
is because both of them are essentially the sum of as many per-sample costs as
there are examples in the training set. In other words,
\begin{align*}
    &\tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \tilde{C}(\vx^n, \vy^n | \TT), \\
    &\nabla \tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \nabla \tilde{C}(\vx^n, \vy^n | \TT).
\end{align*}
And, $N$ goes up to millions or billions very easily these days.

This enormous computational cost involved in each GD step has motivated the {\em
stochastic gradient descent} (SGD) algorithm~\cite{Robbins1951,Bottou1998}. 

First, recall from Eq.~\eqref{eq:empirical_cost} that the cost function we
minimize is the {\em empirical} cost function $\tilde{C}$ which is the
sample-based approximation to the {\em expected} cost function $C$. This
approximation was done by assuming that the training examples were drawn
randomly from the data distribution $p_{\text{data}}$:
\begin{align*}
    C(\TT) \approx \tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N D(\hat{\vy^{n}},
    \vy^{n}).
\end{align*}
In fact, as long as this assumption on the training set holds, we can always
approximate the expected cost function with a fewer number of training examples:
\begin{align*}
    C(\TT) \approx \tilde{C}_\MM (\TT) = \frac{1}{|\MM|} \sum_{m \in \MM}
    D(\hat{\vy^{m}}, \vy^m),
\end{align*}
where $M \ll N$ and $\MM$ is the indices of the examples in this much smaller
subset of the training set. We call this small subset a {\em minibatch}.

Similarly, this leads to a minibatch-based estimate of the gradient as well:
\begin{align*}
    \nabla \tilde{C}_\MM (\TT) = \frac{1}{|\MM|} \sum_{m \in \MM} \nabla
    D(\hat{\vy^m}, \vy^m).
\end{align*}

It must now be clear to you where I am headed toward. At each GD step, instead
of using the full training set, we will use a small subset $\MM$ which is
randomly selected to compute the gradient estimate. In other words, we use
$\tilde{C}_\MM$ instead of $\tilde{C}$, and $\nabla \tilde{C}_\MM$ instead of
$\nabla \tilde{C}$, in Eq.~\eqref{eq:GD}. 

Because computing $\tilde{C}_\MM$ and $\nabla \tilde{C}_\MM$ is independent of
the size of the training set, we can use SGD to make as many steps as we want
without worrying about the growing size of training examples. This is highly
beneficial, as regardless of how many training examples you used to compute the
gradient, we can only take a tiny step toward that descending direction.
Furthermore, the increased level of noisy in the gradient estimate due to the
small sample size has been suspected to help reaching a better solution in 
high-dimensional non-convex problems (such as those in training deep neural
networks) \cite{Lecun1998a}.\footnote{
    Why would this be the case? It is worth thinking about this issue further.
}

We can set $M$ to be any constant, and in an extreme, we can set it to $1$ as
well. In this case, we call it online SGD.\footnote{
    Okay, this is not true in a strict sense. SGD is an online algorithm with
    $M=1$ originally, and using $M>1$, is a variant of SGD, often called,
    minibatch SGD. However, as using minibatches ($M>1$) is almost always the
    case in practice, I will refer to minibatch SGD as SGD, and to the original
    SGD as online SGD.
} Surprisingly, already in 1951, it was shown that using a single example each
time is enough for the SGD to converge to a minimum (under certain conditions,
obviously) \cite{Robbins1951}.

This SGD algorithm will be at the core of this course and will be discussed
further in the future lectures.


\section{When do we stop learning?}
\label{sec:model_selection}

From here on, I assume that we approximate the ground truth function by
iteratively refining its set of parameters, in most cases using {\em stochastic
gradient descent}. In other words, learning of a machine that approximates the
true generating function $f$ happens gradually as the machine goes over the
training examples little by little over time.

Let us go over again what kind of constraints/issue we have first:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lack of access to the expected cost function $C(\TT)$
    \item Computationally expensive empirical cost function $\tilde{C}(\TT)$
    \item (Potential) non-convexity of the empirical cost function
        $\tilde{C}(\TT)$
\end{enumerate}

The most severe issue is that we do not have access to the expected cost
function which is the one we want to minimize in order to work well with {\em
any} pair of input $\vx$ and output $\vy$. Instead, we have access to the
empirical cost function which is a finite sample approximation to the expected
cost function. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/cost_figure.png}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.39\textwidth}
        \caption{(\textcolor{blue}{blue}) Expected cost function $C(\TT)$.
            (\textcolor{red}{red}) Empirical cost function $\tilde{C}(\TT)$.
            The underlying true generating function was $f(x) = \sin(10x) + x$.
            The cost function uses the squared Euclidean distance.
            The empirical cost function was computed based on 10 noisy
            examples of which $x$'s were sampled from the uniform distribution
        between $0$ and $1$. For each sample input $x$, noise from zero-mean Gaussian
    distribution with standard deviation $0.01$ was added to $f(x)$ to emulate
the noisy measurement channel.}
        \label{fig:cost}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Why is this a problem? Because, we do not have a guarantee that the (local)
minimum of the empirical cost function corresponds to the (local) minimum of the
expected cost function. An example of this mismatch between the expected and
empirical cost functions is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cost}.

As in the case shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cost}, it is not desirable to minimize the
empirical cost function perfectly. The parameters that perfectly minimize the
empirical cost function (in the case of
Fig.~\ref{fig:cost}, the slope $a$ of a linear function $f(x) = a x$) will
likely be a sub-optimal cost for the expected cost function about which we
really care. 

\subsection{Early Stopping}
What should we do? There are many ways to avoid this weird contradiction where
we want to optimize the cost function well but not too well. Among those, one
most important trick is {\em early stopping}, which is only applicable when
iterative optimization is used.

First, we will split the training set $D$ into two partitions $D_{\train}$ and
$D_{\val}$.\footnote{
    Later on, we will split it further into three partitions.
}
We call them a training set and a validation set, respectively. In practice it
is a good idea to keep $D$ much larger than $D'$, because of the reasons that
will become clear shortly.

Further, let us define the training cost as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:train_c}
    \tilde{C}(\TT) = C_{\train}(\TT) = \frac{1}{|D_{\train}|} \sum_{(x,y) \in
    D_{\train}} D_{\train}(\hat{y}, y),
\end{align}
and the validation cost as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:val_c}
    C_{\val}(\TT) = \frac{1}{|D_{\val}|} \sum_{(x,y) \in D_{\val}} D(\hat{y}, y).
\end{align}
With these two cost functions we are all ready to use early stopping now. 

After every few updates using SGD (or GD), the validation cost function is
evaluated with the current set of parameters. The parameters are updated (i.e.,
the training cost function is optimized) until the validation cost does not
decrease, or starts to increase instead of decreasing.

That's it! It is almost free, as long as the size of the validation set is
reasonable, since each evaluation is at most as expensive as computing the
gradient of the empirical cost function. Because of the simplicity and
effectiveness, this early stopping strategy has become {\em de facto} standard
in deep learning and in general machine learning.

The question that needs to be asked here is what the validation cost function
does here. Clearly, it approximates the expected cost function $C$, similarly to
the empirical cost function $\tilde{C}$ as well as the training cost function
$C_{\train}$. In the infinite limit of the size of either training or validation
set, they should coincide, but in the case of a finite set, those two cost
functions differ by the noise in sampling (sampling pairs from the data
distribution) and observation (noise in $\vy=f(\vx)$.)

The fact that we explicitly optimize the training cost function implies that
there is a possibility (in fact, almost surely in practice) that the set of
parameters found by this optimization process may capture not only the
underlying generating function but also noise in the observation and sampling
procedure. This is an issue, because we want our machine to approximate the true
generating function not the noise process involved. 

The validation cost function measures both the true generating structure as well
as noise injected during sampling and observation. However, assuming that noise
is not correlated with the underlying generating function, noise introduced in
the validation cost function differs from that in the training cost function. In
other words, the set of parameters that perfectly minimizes the training cost
function (thereby capturing even noise in the training set) will be penalized
when measured by the validation cost function. 

\subsection{Model Selection}
In fact, the use of the validation cost does not stop at the early stopping.
Rather, it has a more general role in model selection. First, we must talk about
model selection itself.

This whole procedure of optimization, or learning, can be cast as a process of
searching for the best {\em hypothesis} over the entire space $\HH$ of
hypotheses.  Here, each hypothesis corresponds to each possible function (with a
unique set of parameters and a unique functional form) that takes the input
$\vx$ and output $\vy$. In the case of regression ($\vx \in \RR^d$ and $\vy \in
\RR$), the hypothesis space includes an $n$-th order polynomial function 
\begin{align*}
    f(x) = \sum_{\sum_{k=1}^d i_k = n, i_k \geq 0}
    a_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k} \prod_{k'=1}^d x_{k'}^{i_k},
\end{align*}
where $a_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k}$'s are the coefficients, and 
any other functional form that you can imagine as long as it can process $\vx$
and return a real-valued scalar.  In the case of neural networks, this space
includes all the possible model architectures which are defined by the number of
layers, the type of nonlinearities, the number of hidden units in each layer and
so on. 

Let us use
$M \in \HH$ to denote one hypothesis.\footnote{
    $M$, because each hypothesis corresponds to one learning {\em machine}.
} One important thing to remember is that the parameter space is only a subset
of the hypothesis space, because the parameter space is defined by a family of
hypotheses (the parameter space of a linear function cannot include a set of
parameters for a second-order polynomial function.)

Given a definition of expected cost function, we can {\em score} each hypothesis
$M$ by the corresponding cost $C_M$. Then, the whole goal of function
approximation boils down to the search for a hypothesis $M$ with the minimal
expected cost function $C$. But, of course, we do not have access to the
expected cost function and resort to the empirical cost function based on a
given training set. 

The optimization-based approach we discussed so far searches for the best
hypothesis based on the empirical cost iteratively. However, because of the
issue of {\em overfitting} which means that the optimization algorithm overshot
and missed the local minimum of the expected cost function (because it was aimed
at the local minimum of the empirical cost function), I introduced the concept
of early stopping based on the validation cost.

This is unfortunately not satisfactory, as we have only searched for the best
hypothesis inside a small subset of the whole hypothesis space $\HH$. What if
another subset of the hypothesis space includes a function that better suits the
underlying generating function $f$? Are we doomed?

It is clearly better to try more than one subsets of the hypothesis space. For
instance, for a regression task, we can try linear functions ($\HH_1$),
quadratic (second-order polynomial) functions ($\HH_2$) and sinusoidal functions
($\HH_3$). Let's say for each of these subsets, we found the best hypothesis
(using iterative optimization and early stopping); $M_{\HH_1}$, $M_{\HH_2}$ and
$M_{\HH_3}$. Then, the question is how we should choose one of those hypotheses.

Similar to what we've done with early stopping, we can use the validation cost
to compare these hypotheses. Among those three we choose one that has the
smallest validation cost $C_{\val}(M)$.

This is one way to do {\em model selection}, and we will talk about another way
to do this later.

\section{Evaluation}

But, wait, if this is an argument for using the validation cost to {\em early
stop} the optimization (or learning), one needs to notice something weird. What
is it?

Because we used the validation cost to stop the optimization, there is a chance
that the set of parameters we found is optimal for the validation set (whose
structure consists of both the true generating function and sampling/observation
noise), but not to the general data distribution. This means that we cannot tell
whether the function estimate $\hat{f}$ approximating the true generating
function $f$ is a good fit by simply early stopping based on the validation
cost.  Once the optimization is done, we need yet another metric to see how well
the learned function estimate $\hat{f}$ approximates $f$.

Therefore, we need to split the training set not into two partitions but into
{\em three} partitions. We call them a training set $D_{\train}$, a validation
set $D_{\val}$ and a test set $D_{\test}$. Consequently, we will have three cost
functions; a training cost function $C_{\train}$, a validation cost function
$C_{\val}$ and a test cost function $C_{\test}$, similarly to
Eqs.~\ref{eq:train_c}--\ref{eq:val_c}.

This test cost function is the one we use to compare different hypotheses, or
models, fairly. Any hypothesis that worked best in terms of the test cost is the
one that you choose.

\paragraph{Let's not Cheat}
One most important lesson here is that you {\em must never look at a test set}.
As soon as you take a peak at the test set, it will influence your choice in the
model structure as well as any other hyperparameters biasing toward a better
test cost. The best option is to never ever look at the test set until it is
absolutely needed (e.g., need to present your result.)

\section{Linear Regression for Non-Linear Functions}

Let us start with a simple linear function to approximate a true generating
function such that
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\vy} = f(\vx) = \mW^\top \vx, 
\end{align*}
where $\mW \in \RR^{d \times l}$ is the weight matrix. In this case, this weight
matrix is the only parameter, i.e., $\TT=\left\{ \mW \right\}$.

The empirical cost function is then
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{2} \left\| \vy^n - \mW^\top \vx^n
    \right\|^2_2.
\end{align*}

The gradient of the empirical cost function is
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:grad_lin}
    \nabla \tilde{C}(\TT) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N 
    \left( \vy^n - \mW^\top \vx^n\right)^\top \vx^n.
\end{align}

With these two well defined, we can use the iterative optimization algorithm,
such as GD or SGD, to find the best $\mW$ that minimizes the empirical cost
function.\footnote{
    In fact, looking at Eq.~\eqref{eq:grad_lin}, it's quite clear that you can
    compute the optimal $\mW$ analytically. See Eq.~\eqref{eq:opt_lin}.
}
Or, better is to use a validation set to stop the optimization
algorithm at the point of the minimal validation cost function (remember early
stopping?)

Now, but we are not too satisfied with a linear network, are we?

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\label{sec:feature_extraction}

Why are we not satisfied?

First, we are not sure whether the true generating function $f$ was a linear
function. If it is not, can we expect linear regression to approximate the true
function well? Of course, not. We will talk about this shortly.

Second, because we were {\em given} $\vx$ (meaning we did not have much control
over what we want to measure as $\vx$), it is unclear how well $\vx$ represents
the input. For instance, consider doing a sales forecast of air conditioner at
one store which opened five years ago. The input $x$ is the number of days since
the opening date of the store (1 Jan 2009), and the output $y$ is the number of
units sold on each day.

Clearly, in this example, the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is not linear.
Furthermore, perhaps the most important feature for predicting the sales of air
conditioners is missing from the input $x$, which is a month (or a season, if
you prefer.) It is likely that the sales bottoms out during the winter (perhaps
sometime around December, January and February,) and it hits the peak during
summer months (around May, June and July.) In other words, if we look at how far
the month is away from July, we can predict the sales quite well even with 
linear regression.

Let us call this quantity $\phi(x)$, or equivalent {\em feature}, such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:feat_month}
    \phi(x) = \left| m(x) - \alpha \right|,
\end{align}
where $m(x) \in \left\{ 1,2,\ldots,12\right\}$ is the month of $x$ and
$\alpha=5.5$.  With this
feature, we can fit linear regression to better approximate the sales figure of
air conditioners. Furthermore, we can add yet another feature to improve the
predictive performance. For instance, one such feature can be which day of week
$x$ is. 

This whole process of extracting a good set of features that will make our
choice of parametric function family (such as linear regression in this case) is
called {\em feature extraction}. This feature extraction is an important step in
machine learning and has often been at the core of many applications such as
computer vision (the representative example is SIFT~\cite{lowe1999object}.)

Feature extraction often requires heavy knowledge of the domain in which this
function approximation is applied. To use linear regression for computer vision,
it is a good idea to use computer vision knowledge to extract a good set of
features. If we want to use it for environmental problems, we must first notice
which features must be important and how they should be represented for linear
regression to work. 

This is okay for a machine learning practitioner in a particular field, because
the person has in-depth knowledge about the field. There are however many cases
where there's simply not enough domain knowledge to exploit. To make the matter
worse, it is likely that the domain knowledge is not correct, making the whole
business of using manually extracted features futile.

\section{Conditional Distribution Approximation}
\label{sec:distribution_approx}

I have mainly described so far as if the function we approximate or the function
we use to approximate returns only a constant value, as in one point $\vy$ in
the output space. This is however not true, and in fact, the function can return
anything including a {\em
distribution}~\cite{Bridle1990,denker1991transforming,bishop1994mixture}.

Let's first decompose the data distribution $p_{\data}$ into the product
of two terms:
\begin{align*}
    p_{\data}(\vx, \vy) = p_{\data}(\vx) p_{\data}(\vy |\vx).
\end{align*}
It becomes clear that one way to sample from $p_{\data}$ is to sample an input
$\vx^n$ from $p_{\data}(\vx)$ and subsequently sample the corresponding output
$\vy^n$ from the conditional distribution $p_{\data}(\vy | \vx^n)$. 

This implies that the function approximation of the generating function ($f:
\vx \to \vy$) is effectively equivalent to approximating the conditional
distribution $p_{\data}(\vy | \vx)$. This may suddenly sound much more
complicated, but it should not alarm you at all.  As long as we choose to use a
distribution parametrized by a small number of parameters to approximate the
conditional distribution $p_{\data}(\vy | \vx)$, this is quite manageable
without almost any modification to the expected and empirical cost functions we
have discussed. 

Let us use $\TT(\vx)$ to denote a set of parameters for the probability
distribution $\tilde{p}(\vy|\vx, \TT(\vx))$ approximating the true, underlying
probability distribution $p_{\data}(\vy|\vx)$. As the notation suggests, the
function now returns {\em the parameters of the distribution} $\TT(\vx)$ given
the input $\vx$. 

For example, let's say $\vy \in \left\{ 0, 1\right\}^k$ is a binary vector and
we chose to use independent Bernoulli distribution to approximate the
conditional distribution $p_{\data}(\vy | \vx)$. In this case, the parameters
that define the conditional distribution are the means of $k$ dimensions:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:bernoulli}
    \tilde{p}(\vy | \vx) = \prod_{k'=1}^k p(y_{k'}|\vx) = 
    \prod_{k'=1}^k \mu_{k'}^{y_{k'}} (1-\mu_{k'})^{1-y_{k'}}.
\end{align}
Then the function $\TT(\vx)$ should output a $k$-dimensional vector of which
each element is between 0 and 1.

Another example: let's say $\vy \in \RR^k$ is a real-valued vector. It is quite
natural to use a Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix to
approximate the conditional distribution $p(\vy | \vx)$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gaussian}
    \tilde{p}(\vy | \vx) = \prod_{k'=1}^k \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{k'}} 
\exp\left( \frac{(y_{k'} - \mu_{k'})^2}{2\sigma_{k'}^2} \right).
\end{align}
The parameters for this conditional distribution are $\TT(\vx) = \left\{ 
    \mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_k, \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_k
\right\}$, where $\mu_k \in \RR$ and $\sigma_k \in \RR_{>0}$.

In this case of probability approximation, it is natural to use
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to measure the distance.\footnote{
    Again, we use a loose definition of the distance where triangular inequality
    is not enforced.
} 
The KL divergence from one distribution $P$ to the other $Q$ is
defined\footnote{
    Why don't I say the KL divergence between two distributions here? Because,
    the KL divergence is not a symmetric measure, i.e., $\KL(P\|Q) \neq
    \KL(Q\|P)$.
}
by
\begin{align*}
    \KL(P\|Q) = \int P(\vx) \log \frac{P(\vx)}{Q(\vx)} \dd{\vx}.
\end{align*}
In our case of function/distribution approximation, we want to minimize the KL
divergence from the data distribution $p_{\data}(\vy|\vx)$ to the approximate
distribution $\tilde{p}(\vy | \vx)$ averaged over the data distribution
$p_{\data}(\vx)$:
\begin{align*}
    C(\TT) = \int p_{\data}(\vx) \KL(p_{\data}\|\tilde{p}) \dd{\vx} = 
    \int p_{\data}(\vx) \int p_{\data}(\vy|\vx) \log \frac{p_{\data}
    (\vy|\vx)}{\tilde{p}(\vy|\vx)} \dd{\vy} \dd{\vx}.
\end{align*}
But again we do not have access to $p_{\data}$ and cannot compute this expected
cost function.

Similarly to how we defined the empirical cost function earlier, we must
approximate this expected KL divergence using the training set: 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:kl_train}
    \tilde{C}(\TT) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N -\log \tilde{p}(\vy^n|\vx^n).
\end{align}
As an example, if we choose to return the binary vector $\vy$ as in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:bernoulli}, the empirical cost function will be
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{C}(\TT) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N 
    \sum_{k'=1}^k y_{k'} \log \mu_{k'} + (1-y_{k'}) \log (1 - \mu_{k'}),
\end{align*}
which is often called a {\em cross entropy cost}. In the case of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:gaussian}, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:kl_gaussian}
    \tilde{C}(\TT) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N 
    \sum_{k'=1}^k \frac{(y_{k'} - \mu_{k'})^2}{2\sigma_{k'}^2} - \log
        \sigma_{k'}.
\end{align}

Do you see something interesting in Eq.~\eqref{eq:kl_gaussian}? If we assume
that the function outputs $1$ for all $\sigma_{k'}$'s, we see that this cost
function reduces to that using the Euclidean distance between the true output
$\vy$ and the mean $\vmu$. What does this mean?

There will be many occasions later on to discuss more about this perspective
when we discuss language modelling. However, one thing we must keep in our mind
is that there is nothing different between approximating a function and a
distribution.

\subsection{Why do we want to do this?}

Before we move on to the main topic of today's lecture, let's try to understand
why we want to output the distribution. Unlike returning a single point in the
space, the distribution returned by the function $f$ incorporates both the most
likely outcome $\hat{y}$ as well as the uncertainty associated with this value.

In the case of the Gaussian output in Eq.~\eqref{eq:gaussian}, the standard
deviation $\sigma_{k'}$, or the variance $\sigma_{k'}^2$, indicates how
uncertain the function is about the output centered at $\mu_{k'}$. Similarly,
the mean $\mu_{k'}$ of the Bernoulli output in Eq.~\eqref{eq:bernoulli} is
directly proportional to the function's confidence in predicting that the
$k'$-th dimension of the output is $1$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/duck_rabbit.png}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.39\textwidth}
        \caption{Is this a duck or a rabbit? \cite{kuhn2012structure} At the end
        of the day, we want our function $f$ to return a conditional
    distribution saying that $p(\text{duck}|\vx) = p(\text{rabbit}|\vx)$,
instead of returning {\em the} answer out of these two possible answers.}
        \label{fig:duck_rabbit}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

This is useful in many aspects, but one important aspect is that it reflects the
natural uncertainty of the underlying generating function. One input $\vx$ may
be interpreted in more than one ways, leading to two possible outputs, which
happens more often than not in the real world. For instance, the famous picture
in Fig.~\ref{fig:duck_rabbit} can be viewed as a picture of a duck or a picture
of a rabbit, in which case the function needs to output the probability
distribution by which the same probability mass is assigned to both a duck and a
rabbit. Furthermore, there is observational noise that cannot easily be
identified and ignored by the function, in which case the function should return
the uncertainty due to the observational noise along with the most likely (or
the average) prediction.

\subsection{Other Distributions}
\label{sec:other_dist}

I have described two distributions (densities) that are widely used: 
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item Bernoulli distribution: binary classification
    \item Gaussian distribution: real value regression
\end{itemize}
Here, let me present one more distribution which we will use almost everyday
through this course.

\paragraph{Categorical Distribution: Multi-Class Classification}

Multi-class classification is a task in which each example belongs to one of $K$
classes. For each input $x$, the problem reduces to find a probability $p_k(x)$
of the $k$-th class under the constraint that 
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^K p_k(x)=1
\end{align*}

It is clear that in this case, the function $f$ returns $K$ values $\left\{
\mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_K \right\}$, each of which is between $0$ and $1$.
Furthermore, the sum of $\mu_k$'s must sum to $1$. This can be achieved easily
by letting $f$ to compute affine transformation of $x$ (or $\phi(x)$) to return
$K$ (unbounded) real values followed by a so called {\em softmax}
function~\cite{Bridle1990}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:softmax}
    \mu_k = \frac{\exp(w_k^\top \phi(x) + b_k)}{\sum_{k'=1}^K \exp(w_{k'}^\top
    \phi(x) + b_k)},
\end{align}
where $w_k \in \RR^{\dim(\phi(x))}$ and $b_k \in \RR$ are the parameters of
affine transformation.

In this case, the (empirical) cost function based on the KL divergence is
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cat_crossentropy}
    C(\TT) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K \II_{k=y^n} \mu_k,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:indicator_function}
    \II_{k=y^n} = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{c c}
            1, & \text{if }k=y^n \\
            0, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align}

\chapter{Feature Extraction is also a Function}
\label{chap:feature_ext}

We talked about the manual feature extraction in the previous lecture (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:feature_extraction}. But, this is quite unsatisfactory, because
this whole process of manual feature extraction is heavily dependent on the
domain knowledge, meaning that we cannot have a generic principle on which we
design features. This raises a question: instead of manually designing features
ourselves, is it possible for this to happen automatically?

One thing we notice is that the feature extraction process $\phi(\vx)$ is
nothing but a {\em function}. A function of a function is a function, right? In
other words, we will extend our definition of the function to include the
feature extraction function:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{\vy} = f(\phi(\vx)).
\end{align*}

We will assume that the feature extraction function $\phi$ is also parametrized,
and its parameters are included in the set of parameters which includes those of
$f$. As an example, $\alpha$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:feat_month} is a parameter of the
feature extraction $\phi$.

A natural next question is which family of parametric functions we should use
for $\phi$. We run into the same issue we talked about earlier in
Sec.~\ref{sec:model_selection}: the size of hypothesis space is simply too
large!

Instead of choosing one great feature extraction function, we can go for a stack
of simple transformations which are all learned.\footnote{
    A great article about this was posted recently in
    \url{http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/}.
}
Each transformation can be as simple as affine transformation followed by a
simple point-wise nonlinearity:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:layer}
    \phi_0(\vx) = g(\mW_0 \vx + \vb_0),
\end{align}
where $\mW_0$ is the weight matrix, $\vb_0$ is the bias and $g$ is a point-wise
nonlinearity such as $\tanh$.\footnote{
    Some of the widely used nonlinearities are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sigmoid: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}$
        \item Hyperbolic function: $\tanh(x) = \frac{1-\exp(-2x)}{1+\exp(-2x)}$
        \item Rectified linear unit: $\rect(x) = \max(0, x)$
    \end{itemize}
}

One interesting thing is that if the dimensionality of the transformed feature
vector $\phi_0(\vx)$ is {\em much} larger than that of $\vx$, the function
$f(\phi_0(\vx))$ can approximate any function from $\vx$ to $\vy$ under some
assumptions, even when the parameters $\mW_0$ and $\vb_0$ are randomly
selected!~\cite{Cover1965} 

The problem solved, right? We just put a huge matrix $\mW_0$, apply some
nonlinear function $g$ to it and fit linear regression as I described earlier.
We don't even need to touch $\mW_0$ and $\vb_0$. All we need to do is replace
the input $\vx^n$ of all the pairs in the training set to $\phi_0(\vx^n)$.

In fact, there is a group of researchers claiming to have figured this out by
themselves less than a decade ago (as of 2015) who call this model an {\em
extreme learning machine}~\cite{Huang2006}. There have been some debates about
this so-called extreme learning machine. Here I will not make any comment
myself, but would be a good exercise for you to figure out why there has been
debates about this.

But, regardlessly, this is not what we want.\footnote{
    And, more importantly, I will not accept any final project proposal whose
    main model is based on the ELM.
}
What we want is to fully tune the whole thing.

\section{Multilayer Perceptron}
\label{sec:mlp}

The basic idea of multilayer perceptron is to stack a large number of those
feature extraction {\em layers} in Eq.~\eqref{eq:layer} between the input and
the output. This idea is as old as the whole field of neural network research,
dating back to early 1960s~\cite{Rosenblatt1962}. However, it took many more
years for people to figure out a way to tune the whole network, both $f$ and
$\phi$'s together. See \cite{schmidhuber2015deep} and \cite{lecun2015deep}, if you
are interested in the history.

\subsection{Example: Binary classification with a single hidden unit}

Let us start with the simplest example. The input $x \in \RR$ is a real-valued
scalar, and the output $y \in \left\{0,1\right\}$ is a binary value
corresponding to the input's label. The feature extractor $\phi$ is defined as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:phi}
    \phi(x) = \sigma(u x + c),
\end{align}
where $u$ and $c$ are the parameters. The function $f$ returns the mean of the
Bernoulli conditional distribution $p(y|x)$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:f}
    \mu = f(x) = \sigma(w \phi(x) + b).
\end{align}
In both of these equations, $\sigma$ is a sigmoid function:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sigmoid}
    \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}.
\end{align}

We use the KL divergence to measure the distance between the true conditional
distribution $p(y|x)$ and the predicted conditional distribution $\hat{p}(y|x)$.
\begin{align*}
    \KL(p\|\hat{p}) =& \sum_{y \in \left\{0, 1\right\}} p(y|x) \log
    \frac{p(y|x)}{\hat{p}(y|x)} \\
    =& \sum_{y \in \left\{0, 1\right\}} p(y|x) \log p(y|x) - p(y|x) \log
    {\hat{p}(y|x)}.
\end{align*}
Note that the first term in the summation $p(y|x) \log p(y|x)$ can be safely
ignored in our case. Why? Because, this does not concern $\tilde{p}$ which is
one we change in order to minimize this KL divergence.

Let's approximate this KL divergence with a single sample from $p(y|x)$ and
leave only the relevant part. We will call this a per-sample cost:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cost_bernoulli}
    C_x =& - \log \hat{p}(y|x) \\
    =& - \log \mu^y (1-\mu)^{1-y} \\
    =& - y \log \mu - (1-y) \log (1-\mu),
\end{align}
where $\mu$ is from Eq.~\eqref{eq:f}.  It is okay to work with this per-sample
cost function instead of the full cost function, because the full cost function
is almost always the (unweighted) sum of these per-sample cost functions. See
Eq.~\eqref{eq:empirical_cost}.

We now need to compute the gradient of this cost function $C_x$ with respect to
all the parameters $w$, $b$, $u$ and $c$. First, let's start with $w$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial \mu}
    \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \underline{\mu}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial w},
\end{align*}
which is a simple application of chain rule of derivatives. Compare this to
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial b} = \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial \mu}
    \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \underline{\mu}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial b}.
\end{align*}
In both equations, $\underline{\mu} = w \phi(x) + b$ which is the input to $f$.


Both of these derivatives {\em share} $\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial
\mu}\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial \underline{\mu}}$, where
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:out_deriv}
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial \mu} \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial
    \underline{\mu}}}_{=\mu'} = 
    -\frac{y}{\mu}\mu' +
    \frac{1-y}{1-\mu}\mu' 
    = \frac{-y + y\mu + \mu - y\mu }{\mu(1-\mu)}\mu' 
    = \frac{\mu - y}{\mu(1-\mu)}\mu' 
    = \mu - y,
\end{align}
because the derivative of the sigmoid function $\frac{\partial \mu}{\partial
\underline{\mu}}$ is
\begin{align*}
    \mu' = \mu (1-\mu).
\end{align*}
Note that this corresponds to computing the difference between the correct label
$y$ and the predicted label (probability) $\mu$.

Given this output derivative $\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial \underline{\mu}}$, all we need to
compute are
\begin{align*}
    &\frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial w} = \phi(x) \\
    &\frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial b} = 1.
\end{align*}
From these computations, we see that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:c_w}
    &\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial w} = (\mu - y) \phi(x), \\
    \label{eq:c_b}
    &\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial b} = (\mu - y).
\end{align}

Let us continue on to $u$ and $c$. We can again rewrite the derivatives w.r.t.
these into
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial u} =& \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial
    \underline{\mu}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial \phi}
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \underline{\phi}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial u} \\
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial c} =& \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial
    \underline{\mu}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial \phi}
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \underline{\phi}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial c},
\end{align*}
where $\underline{\phi}$ is the input to $\phi$ similarly to $\underline{\mu}$
was to the input to $\mu$.

There are two things to notice here. First, we already have $\frac{\partial
C_x}{\partial \underline{\mu}}$ from computing the derivatives w.r.t. $w$ and
$b$, meaning there is no need to re-compute it. Second, $\frac{\partial
\underline{\mu}}{\partial \underline{\phi}}$ is shared between the derivatives
w.r.t. $u$ and $c$.

Therefore, we first compute $\frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial
\underline{\phi}}$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial \phi}\underbrace{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial
    \underline{\phi}}}_{=\phi'} = w \phi' = w \phi(x) (1- \phi(x))
\end{align*}
Next, we compute 
\begin{align*}
    &\frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial u} = x \\
    &\frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial c} = 1.
\end{align*}

Now all the ingredients are there:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial u} =& (\mu -y) w \phi(x) (1-\phi(x)) x \\
    \frac{\partial C_x}{\partial c} =& (\mu -y) w \phi(x) (1-\phi(x)).
\end{align*}

The most important lession to learn from here is that most of the computations
needed to get the derivatives in this seemingly complicated multilayered
computational graph (multilayer perceptron) are {\em shared}. At the end of the
day, the amount of computation needed to compute the gradient of the cost
function w.r.t. all the parameters in the network is only as expensive as
computing the cost function itself.

\subsection{Example: Binary classification with more than one hidden units}
\label{sec:example2}

Let us try to generalize this simple, or rather simplest model, into a slightly
more general setting. We will still look at the binary classification but with
multiple hidden units and a multidimensional input such that:
\begin{align*}
    \phi(x) = U x + c,
\end{align*}
where $U \in \RR^{l \times d}$ and $c \in \RR^l$. Consequently, $w$ will be a
$l$-dimensional vector.

The output derivative $\frac{\partial C_x}{\partial \mu}\frac{\partial
\mu}{\partial \underline{\mu}}$ stays same as before. See
Eq.~\eqref{eq:out_deriv}.
However, we note that the derivative of $\underline{\mu}$ with respect to $w$
should now differ, because it's a vector.\footnote{
    The Matrix Cookbook \cite{petersen2008matrix} is a good reference for this
    section.
}
Let's look at what this means.

The $\underline{\mu}$ can be expressed as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:mu_vec}
    \underline{\mu} = w^\top \phi(x) + b = \sum_{i=1}^l w_i \phi_i(x) + b.
\end{align}
In this case, we can start computing the derivative with respect to each element
of $w_i$ separately:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial w_i} = \phi_i(x),
\end{align*}
and will put them into a vector:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial w} = \left[ 
        \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial w_1}, \frac{\partial
        \underline{\mu}}{\partial w_2}, \ldots, \frac{\partial
        \underline{\mu}}{\partial w_l}
    \right]^\top = \left[ \phi_1(x), \phi_2(x), \ldots, \phi_l(x) \right]^\top
    = \phi(x)
\end{align*}

Then, the derivative of the cost function $C_y$ with respect to $w$ can be
written as
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial w} = (\mu -y) \phi(x),
\end{align*}
in which case nothing really changed from the case of a single hidden unit in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:c_w}.

Now, let's look at $\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \phi}$. Again, because
$\phi(x)$ is now a vector, there has to be some changes. Because $\frac{\partial
C_y}{\partial \underline{\mu}}$ is already computed, we only need to look at
$\frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial \phi}$. In fact, the procedure for
computing this is identical to that for computing $\frac{\partial
\underline{\mu}}{\partial w}$ due to the symmetry in Eq.~\eqref{eq:mu_vec}. That
is,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\mu}}{\partial \phi} = w
\end{align*}

Next, what about $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \underline{\phi}}$? Because the
nonlinear activation function $\sigma$ is applied element-wise, we can simply
compute this derivative for each element in $\phi(x)$ such that
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \underline{\phi}} = 
    \diag\left(\left[ \phi_1'(x), \phi_2'(x), \ldots, \phi_l'(x)
    \right]^\top\right),
\end{align*}
where $\diag$ returns a diagonal matrix of the input vector. In short, we will
denote this as $\phi'$

Overall so far, we have got
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \underline{\phi}} = 
    (\mu - y)w^\top \phi'(x) = (\mu - y) (w \odot \diag(\phi'(x))),
\end{align*}
where $\odot$ is an element-wise multiplication.

Now it is time to compute $\frac{\partial
\underline{\phi}}{\partial U}$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial U} = \frac{\partial U^\top
    x}{\partial U} = x,
\end{align*}
according to the Matrix Cookbook \cite{petersen2008matrix}. Then, let's look at
the whole derivative w.r.t. $U$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial U} = (\mu - y) (w \odot \diag(\phi'(x)))
    x^\top.
\end{align*}
Note that all the vectors in this lecture note are {\em column} vectors.

For $c$, it's straightforward, since 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\phi}}{\partial c} = 1.
\end{align*}


\subsection{Automating Backpropagation}
\label{sec:autodiff}

This procedure, presented as two examples, is called a {\em backpropagation}
algorithm. If you read textbooks on neural networks, you see a fancier way to
explain this backpropagation algorithm by introducing a lot of fancy terms such
as {\em local error} $\delta$ and so on. But, personally I find it much easier
to understand backpropagation as a clever application of the chain rule of
derivatives to a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which each node computes a certain
function $\phi$ using the output of the previous nodes. I will refer to this
DAG as a computational graph from here on.

    \caption{(a) A graphical representation of the computational graph of the
    example network from Sec.~\ref{sec:example2}. (b) A graphical illustration
    of a function node ({\color{blue} $\to$}: forward pass, {\color{red}
$\leftarrow$}: backward pass.)}
    \label{fig:comp_graph}
\end{figure}

A typical computational graph looks like the one in Fig.~\ref{fig:comp_graph}~(a).
This computational graph has two types of nodes; (1) function node ($\bigcirc$)
and (2) variable node ($\Box$). There are four different types of function
nodes; (1) $\text{MatMul}(A,B) = AB$, (2) $\text{MatSum}(A,B)=A+B$, (3)
$\sigma$: element-wise sigmoid function  and (4) $C_y$: cost node. The variables
nodes correspond to either parameters or data ($x$ and $y$.) Each function node
has a number associated with it to distinguish between the nodes of the same
function.

Now, in this computational graph, let us start computing the gradient using the
backpropagation algorithm. We start from the last code, $C_y$, by computing
$\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \sigma^1}$.
Then, the function node $\sigma^1$ will compute its own derivative
$\frac{\partial \sigma^1}{\partial \text{MatSum}^1}$ and multiply it with
$\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \sigma^1}$ passed {\em back} from the function
node $C_y$. So far we've computed
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dC_dMS1}
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \text{MatSum}^1} = \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \sigma^1} \frac{\partial \sigma^1}{\partial
    \text{MatSum}^1}
\end{align}

The function node MatSum$^1$ has two inputs $b$ and the output of MatMul$^1$.
Thus, this node computes two derivatives $\frac{\partial
\text{MatSum}^1}{\partial b}$ and $\frac{\partial \text{MatSum}^1}{\partial
\text{MatMul}^1}$. Each of these is multiplied with the backpropagated
derivative $\frac{\partial C_y}{\partial \text{MatSum}^1}$ from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:dC_dMS1}. At this point, we already have the derivative of the
cost function $C_y$ w.r.t. one of the parameters $b$:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial b} = \frac{\partial C_y}{\partial
    \text{MatSum}^1} \frac{\partial \text{MatSum}^1}{\partial b}
\end{align*}

This process continues mechanically until the very beginning of the graph (a set
of root variable nodes) is reached. All we need in this process of
backpropagating the derivatives is that each function node implements both {\em
forward computation} as well as {\em backward computation}. In the backward
computation, the function node received the derivative from the next function
node, evaluates its own derivative with respect to the inputs (at the point of
the forward activation) and passes theses
derivatives to the corresponding previous nodes. See
Fig.~\ref{fig:comp_graph}~(b) for the graphical illustration.

Importantly, the inner mechanism of a function node does not change depending on
its context (or equivalently where the node is placed in a computational graph.)
In other words, if each type of function nodes is implemented in advance, it
becomes trivial to build a complicated neural network (including multilayer
perceptrons) and compute the gradient of the cost function (which is one such
function node in the graph) with respect to all the parameters as well as all
the inputs.

This is a special case, called the reverse mode, of automatic
differentiation.\footnote{
    If anyone's interested in digging more into the whole field of automatic
    differentiation, try to Google it and you'll find tons of materials.
} It is probably the most valuable tool in deep learning, and fortunately many
widely used toolkits such as Theano~\cite{bergstra2010theano,bastien2012theano}
have implemented this reverse mode of automatic differentiation with an
extensive number of function nodes used in deep learning everyday.

Before finishing this discussion on automating backpropagation, I'd like you to
think of pushing this even further. For instance, you can think of each function
node returning not its numerical derivative on its backward pass, but a
computational sub-graph computing its derivative. This means that it will return
a {\em computational graph of gradient}, where the output is the derivatives of
all the variable nodes (or a subset of them.) Then, we can use the same facility
to compute the second-order derivatives, right? 

\subsection{What if a Function is {\em not} Differentiable?}
\label{sec:nonlinearities}

From the description so far, one thing we notice is that backpropagation works
only when each and every function node (in a computational graph) is
differentiable. In other words, the nonlinear activation function must be chosen
such that almost everywhere it is differentiable. All three activation functions
I have presented so far have this property.

\paragraph{Logistic Functions}
A sigmoid function is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)},
\end{align*}
and its derivative is
\begin{align*}
    \sigma'(x) = \sigma(x) (1 - \sigma(x)).
\end{align*}

A hyperbolic tangent function is
\begin{align*}
    \tanh(x) =  \frac{\exp(2x) -1}{\exp(2x) + 1},
\end{align*}
and its derivative is 
\begin{align*}
    \tanh'(x) = \left(\frac{2}{\exp(x)+\exp(-x)}\right)^2.
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Piece-wise Linear Functions}

I described a rectified linear unit (rectifier or ReLU,
\cite{nair2010rectified,glorot2011deep}) earlier:
\begin{align*}
    \rect(x) = \max(0, x).
\end{align*}
It is clear that this function is not strictly differentiable, because of the
discontinuity at $x=0$. However, the chance of the input to this rectifier lands
exactly at $0$ has zero probability, meaning that we can forget about this
extremely unlikely event. The derivative of the rectifier in this case is
\begin{align*}
    \rect'(x) = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{l l}
            1, & \text{if }x > 0 \\
            0, & \text{if }x \leq 0
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}

Although the rectifier has become the most widely used nonlinearity, especially,
in deep learning's applications to computer vision,\footnote{
    Almost all the winning entries in ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition
    Challenges (ILSVRC) use a convolutional neural network with rectifiers. See
    \url{http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/}.
}
there is a small issue with the rectifier. That is, for a half of the input
space, the derivative is zero, meaning that the error (the output derivative
from Eq.~\eqref{eq:out_deriv}) will be not well propagated through the rectifier
function node.

In \cite{goodfellow2013maxout}, the rectifier was extended to a maxout unit so
as to avoid this issue of the existence of zero-derivative region in the input
to the rectifier. The maxout unit of rank $k$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \maxout(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = \max(x_1, \ldots, x_k),
\end{align*}
and its derivative as
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \maxout}{\partial x_i}(x_1, \dots, x_k) = 
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            1, & \text{if } \max(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = x_i \\
            0, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}
This means that the derivative is backpropagated only through one of the $k$
inputs.

\paragraph{Stochastic Variables}
These activation functions work well with the backpropagation algorithm, because
they are differentiable almost everywhere in the input space. However, what
happens if a function is non-differentiable at all. One such example is a binary
stochastic node, which is computed by
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item Compute $p = \sigma(x)$, where $x$ is the input to the function node.
    \item Consider $p$ as a mean of a Bernoulli distribution, i.e., $\BB(p)$.
    \item Generate one sample $s \in \left\{ 0, 1\right\}$ from the Bernoulli distribution.
    \item Output $s$.
\end{enumerate}
Clearly there is no derivative of this function node. 

Does it mean that we're doomed in this case? Fortunately, no. Although I will
not discuss about this any further in this course,
Bengio~et~al.~\cite{bengio2013estimating} provide an extensive list of
approaches we can take in order to compute the derivative of the stochastic
function nodes.



\chapter{Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Units}

After the last lecture I hope that it has become clear how to build a multilayer
perceptron. Of course, there are so many details that I did not mention, but are
extremely important in practice. For instance, how many layers of simple
transformations Eq.~\eqref{eq:layer} should a multilayer perceptron have for a
certain task? How wide (equiv. $\dim(\phi_0(\vx))$) should each transformation
be? What other transformation layers are there? What kind of learning rate
$\eta$ (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:GD}) should we use? How should we schedule this
learning rate over training? Answers to many of these questions are
unfortunately heavily task-, data- and model-dependent, and I cannot provide any
general answer to them.

%Perhaps more surprisingly, I have not mentioned convolutional neural nets a
%single time. 
%and extensions of
%simple multilayer perceptrons, such as convolutional neural networks which have
%become {\em the} standard in solving many challenging computer vision and speech
%tasks. 

\section{Recurrent Neural Networks}
\label{sec:rnn}

Instead, I will move on to describing how we can build a neural
network\footnote{
    Now, let me begin using a term neural network instead of a general function.
} to handle a variable length input. Until now the input $x$ was assumed to be
either a scalar or a vector of the fixed number of dimensions. From here on
however, we remove this assumption of a fixed size input and consider the case
of having a variable length input $x$. 

What do I mean by a {\em variable length input}? A variable length input $x$ is
a {\em sequence} where each input $x$ has a different number of elements. For
instance, the first training example's input $x^1$ may consist of $l^1$ elements
such that
\begin{align*}
    x^1 = (x^1_1, x^1_2, \ldots, x^1_{l^1}).
\end{align*}
Meanwhile, another example's input $x^n$ may be a sequence of $l^n \neq l^1$ elements:
\begin{align*}
    x^n = (x^n_1, x^n_2, \ldots, x^n_{l^n}).
\end{align*}

Let's go back to very basic about dealing with these kinds of sequences.
Furthermore, let us assume that each element $x_i$ is binary, meaning that it is
either $0$ or $1$. What would be the most natural way to write a function that
returns the number of $1$'s in an input sequence $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{l})$? My
answer is to first build a recursive function called {\sc add1}, shown in
Alg.~\ref{alg:add1}.  This function {\sc add1} will be called for each element of
the input $x$, as in Alg.~\ref{alg:sum}.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\begin{algorithmic}
    \State $s \leftarrow 0$
    \Function{add1}{$v$,$s$}
    \If{$v=0$} 
    \Return{$s$} 
    \Else~
    \Return{$s+1$} 
    \EndIf
    \EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{A function {\sc add1}}
\label{alg:add1}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\begin{algorithmic}
    \State $s \leftarrow 0$
    \For{$i\leftarrow 1,2,\ldots,l$}
    $s \leftarrow \text{\sc{add1}}(x_i,s)$
    \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\caption{A function {\sc add1}}
\label{alg:sum}
\end{algorithm}

There are two important components in this implementation. First, there is a
memory $s$ which counts the number of $1$'s in the input sequence $x$. Second,
a single function {\sc add1} is applied to each symbol in the sequence {\em one
at a time} together with the memory $s$. Thanks to these two properties, our
implementation of the function {\sc add1} can be used with the input sequence of
{\em any length}.

Now let us generalize this idea of having a memory and a recursive function that
works over a variable length sequence. One likely most general case of this idea
is a digital computer we use everyday. A computer program is a sequence $x$ of
instructions $x_i$. A central processing unit (CPU) reads each instruction of
this program and manipulates its registers according to what the instruction
says. Manipulating registers is often equivalent to manipulating any
input--output (I/O) device attached to the CPU. Once one instruction is
executed, the CPU moves on to the next instruction which will be executed with
the content of the registers from the previous step. In other words, these
registers work as a memory in this case ($s$ from Alg.~\ref{alg:sum},) and the
execution of an instruction by the CPU corresponds to a recursive function
({\sc add1} from Alg.~\ref{alg:add1}.)

Both {\sc add1} and CPU are {\em hard coded} in the sense that they do what they
have been designed and manufactured to do. Clearly, this is not what we want,
because nobody knows how to design a CPU or a recursive function for natural
language understanding, which is our ultimate goal. Instead what we want is to
have a parametric recursive function that is able to read a sequence of
(linguistic) symbols and use a memory in order to {\em understand natural
languages}.

To build this parametric recursive function\footnote{
    In neural network research, we call this function a {\em recurrent neural
    network.}
}
that works on a variable-length
input sequence $x=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_l)$, we now know that there needs to be a
memory. We will use one vector $\vh \in \RR^{d_h}$ as this memory vector. As is
clear from Alg.~\ref{alg:add1}, this recursive function takes as input both one
input symbol $x_t$ and the memory vector $\vh$, and it returns the updated memory
vector. It often helps to {\em time index} the memory vector as well, such that
the input to this function is $\vh_{t-1}$ (the memory after processing the
previous symbol $x_{t-1}$,) and we use $\vh_t$ to denote the memory vector
returned by the function. This function is then
\begin{align*}
    h_t = f(x_t, \vh_{t-1})
\end{align*}

Now the big question is what kind of parametric form this recursive function $f$
takes? We will follow the simple transformation layer from Eq.~\eqref{eq:layer},
in which case we get
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rnn_layer}
    f(x_t, \vh_{t-1}) = g(\mW \phi(x_t) + \mU \vh_{t-1}),
\end{align}
where $\phi(x_t)$ is a function that transforms the input symbol (often
discrete) into a $d$-dimensional real-valued vector. $\mW\in \RR^{d_h\times d}$
and $\mU^{d_h \times d_h}$ are parameters of this function. A nonlinear
activation function $g$ can be any function, but for now, we will assume that it
is an element-wise nonlinear function such as $\tanh$.

\subsection{Fixed-Size Output $y$}
\label{sec:rnn_fixed_y}

Because our goal is to approximate an underlying, true function, we now need to
think of how we use this recursive function to {\em return} an output $y$. As
with the case of variable-length sequence input $x$, $y$ can only be either a
fixed-size output, such as a category to which the input $x$ belongs, or a
variable-length sequence output. Here let us discuss the case of having a
fixed-size output $y$.

The most natural approach is to use the last memory vector $\vh_l$ to produce
the output (or more often output distribution.) Consider a task of binary
classification where $y$ is either positive ($1$) or negative ($0$), in which
case a Bernoulli distribution fits perfectly. A Bernoulli distribution is fully
characterized by a single parameter $\mu$. Hence,
\begin{align*}
    \mu = \sigma(\vv^\top \vh_l),
\end{align*}
where $\vv \in \RR^{d_h}$ is a weight vector, and $\sigma$ is a sigmoid
function.

This now looks very much like the multilayer perceptron from Sec.~\ref{sec:mlp}.
The whole function given an input sequence $x$ computes
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rnn_unrolled}
    \mu = \sigma(\vv^\top 
    \underbrace{
        g(\mW \phi(x_l) + \mU 
        g(\mW \phi(x_{l-1}) + \mU
        g(\mW \phi(x_{l-2}) + \cdots
    g(\mW \phi(x_{1}) + \mU \vh_0) \cdots)))}_{(a) \text{ recurrence}}),
\end{align}
where $\vh_0$ is an initial memory state which can be simply set to an all-zero
vector. 

The main difference is that the input is not given only to the first simple
transformation layer, but is given to all those transformation layers (one at a
time.) Also, each transformation layer {\em shares} the parameters $\mW$ and
$\mU$.\footnote{
    Note that for brevity, I have omitted bias vectors. This should not matter
    much, as having a bias vector is equivalent to augmenting the input with a
    constant element whose value is fixed at $1$. Why? Because,
    \begin{align*}
        \left[ \mW ; \vb \right]
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} \vx \\1 \end{array} \right]
        = \mW \vx + \vb
    \end{align*}
    Note that as I have declared before all vectors are {\em column} vectors.
} The first two steps of the recurrence part (a) of Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_unrolled}
are shown as a computational graph in Fig.~\ref{fig:rec_unrolled}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/comp_graph_rec1.pdf}
    \caption{
        Sample computational graph of the recurrence in
        Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_unrolled}.
    }
    \label{fig:rec_unrolled}
\end{figure}

As this is not any special computational graph, the whole discussion on how to
automate backpropagation (computing the gradient of the cost function w.r.t. the
parameters) in Sec.~\ref{sec:autodiff} applies to recurrent neural networks
directly, except for one potentially confusing point.

\subsection{Multiple Child Nodes and Derivatives}

It may be confusing how to handle those parameters that are shared across
multiple time steps; $\mW$ and $\mU$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:rec_unrolled}. In fact, in
the earlier section (Sec.~\ref{sec:autodiff}), we did not discuss about what to
do when the output of one node is fed into multiple function nodes.
Mathematically saying, what do we do in the case of 
\begin{align*}
    c = g(f_1(x), f_2(x), \ldots, f_n(x))?
\end{align*}

$g$ can be any function, but let us look at two widely used cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Addition: $g(f_1(x), \ldots, f_n(x)) = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x)$
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial g} 
            \sum_{i \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\right\}} 
            \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x}.
        \end{align*}
    \item Multiplication: $g(f_1(x), \ldots, f_n(x)) = \prod_{i=1}^n f_i(x)$
        \begin{align*}
            \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial g} 
            \sum_{i \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\right\}} 
            \left(\prod_{j \neq i} f_j(x)\right)
            \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x}.
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

From these two cases, we can see that in general
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial g} 
    \sum_{i \in \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n\right\}} 
    \frac{\partial g}{\partial f_i}
    \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x}.
\end{align*}
This means that when multiple derivatives are {\em backpropagated} into a single
node, the node should first {\em sum them} and multiply its summed derivative
with its own derivative.

What does this mean for the shared parameters of the recurrent neural network?
In an equation,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:bptt}
    \frac{\partial C}{\partial W} =&
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial C}{\partial \MatSum^l}
    }_{(a)}
    \frac{\partial \MatSum^l}{\partial \MatMul^l}
    \frac{\partial \MatMul^l}{\partial W} \\
    +& 
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial C}{\partial \MatSum^l}
    }_{(a)}
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial \MatSum^l}{\partial \MatSum^{l-1}}
    }_{(b)}
    \frac{\partial \MatSum^{l-1}}{\partial \MatMul^{l-1}}
    \frac{\partial \MatMul^{l-1}}{\partial W} 
    \nonumber \\
    +& 
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial C}{\partial \MatSum^l}
    }_{(a)}
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial \MatSum^l}{\partial \MatSum^{l-1}}
    }_{(b)}
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial \MatSum^{l-1}}{\partial \MatSum^{l-2}}
    }_{(c)}
    \frac{\partial \MatSum^{l-2}}{\partial \MatMul^{l-2}}
    \frac{\partial \MatMul^{l-2}}{\partial W} 
    \nonumber \\
    +& 
    \cdots,
    \nonumber
\end{align}
where the superscript $l$ of each function node denotes the layer at which the
function node resides. 

Similarly to what we've observed in Sec.~\ref{sec:autodiff}, many derivatives
are shared across the terms inside the summation in Eq.~\eqref{eq:bptt}. This
allows us to compute the derivative of the cost function w.r.t. the
parameter $W$ efficiently by simply running the recurrent neural network
backward. 

\subsection{Example: Sentiment Analysis}

There is a task in natural language processing called {\em sentiment analysis}.
As the name suggests, the goal of this task is to predict the sentiment of a
given text. This is definitely one function that a human can do fairly well:
when you read a critique's review of a movie, you can easily tell whether the
critique likes, hates or is neutral to the movie. Also, even without a star
rating of a product on Amazon, you can quite easily tell whether a user like it
by reading her/his review of the product.

In this task, an input sequence $x$ is a given text, and the fixed-size output
is its label which is almost always one of positive, negative or neutral. Let us
assume for now that the input is a {\em sequence of words}, where each word
$\vx_i$ is represented as a so-called one-hot vector.\footnote{
    A one-hot vector is a way to represent a discrete symbol as a binary vector.
    The one-hot vector $\vv_i$ of a symbol $i \in V = \left\{ 1, 2, \ldots, |V|
    \right\}$ is 
    \begin{align*}
        \vv_i = [ \underbrace{0, \ldots, 0}_{1,\ldots,i-1}, 
        \underbrace{1}_{i}, \underbrace{0, \ldots, 0}_{i+1, \ldots,
    |V|}]^\top.
    \end{align*}
} In this case, we can use 
\begin{align*}
    \phi(x_t) = \vx_t
\end{align*}
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}.

Once the input sequence, or paragraph in this specific example, is read, we get
the last memory state $\vh_l$ of the recurrent neural network. We will
affine-transform $\vh_l$ followed by the {\em softmax} function to obtain the
conditional distribution of the output $y \in \left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}$ ($1$:
positive, $2$: neutral and $3$: negative):
\begin{align*}
    \mu = \left[ \mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3 \right]^\top = \softmax(\mV \vh_l),
\end{align*}
where $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ and $\mu_3$ are the probabilities of ``positive'',
``neural'' and ``negative''. See Eq.~\eqref{eq:softmax} for more details on the
softmax function.

Because this network returns a categorial distribution, it is natural to use the
(categorical) cross entropy as the cost function. See
Eq.~\eqref{eq:cat_crossentropy}. A working example of this sentiment analyzer
based on recurrent neural networks will be introduced and discussed during the
lab session.\footnote{
    For those eager to learn more, see
    \url{http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html} in advance of the lab
    session.
}


\subsection{Variable-Length Output $y$: $|x|=|y|$}
\label{sec:rnn_x_y}

Let's generalize what we have discussed so far to recurrent neural networks
here. Instead of a fixed-size output $y$, we will assume that the goal is to
label each input symbol, resulting in the output sequence $y=(y_1, y_2, \ldots,
y_l)$ of the same length as the input sequence $x$.

What kind of applications can you think of that returns the output sequence as
long as the input sequence? One of the most widely studied problems in natural
language processing is a problem of classifying each word in a sentence into one
of part-of-speech tags, often called POS tagging (see Sec.~3.1 of
\cite{manning1999foundations}.) Unfortunately, in my personal opinion, this is
perhaps the least interesting problem of all time in natural language
understanding, but perhaps the most well suited problem for this section.

In its simplest form, we can view this problem of POS tagging as classifying
each word in a sentence as one of {\em noun}, {\em verb}, {\em adjective} and
{\em others}. As an example, given the following input sentence $x$
\begin{align*}
    x = (\text{Children}, \text{eat}, \text{sweet}, \text{candy}),
\end{align*}
the goal is to output
\begin{align*}
    y = (\text{noun}, \text{verb}, \text{adjective}, \text{noun}).
\end{align*}

This task can be solved by a recurrent neural network from the preceding section
(Sec.~\ref{sec:rnn_fixed_y}) after a quite trivial modification. Instead of
waiting until the end of the sentence to get the last memory state of the
recurrent neural network, we will use the {\em immediate memory state} to
predict the label at each time step $t$. 

At each time $t$, we get the immediate memory state $\vh_t$ by
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rnn_h_x}
    \vh_t = f(x_t, \vh_{t-1}),
\end{align}
where $f$ is from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}. Instead of continuing on to
processing the next word, we will first predict the label of the $t$-th input
word $x_t$.

This can be done by 
\begin{align*}
    \mu_t = \left[ \mu_{t,1}, \mu_{t,2}, \mu_{t,3}, \mu_{t,4} \right]^\top = \softmax(\mV
    \vh_{t}).
\end{align*}
Four $\mu_{t,i}$'s correspond to the probabilities of the four categories; (1)
noun, (2) verb, (3) adjective and (4) others.

From this output distribution at time step $t$, we can define a {\em per-step},
{\em per-sample} cost function:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cost_per_step}
    C_{x,t}(\TT) = -\sum_{k=1}^K \II_{k=y} \mu_{t,k},
\end{align}
where $K$ is the number of categories, four in this case.  We discussed earlier
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:cat_crossentropy}.
Naturally a per-sample cost function is defined as the sum of these per-step,
per-sample cost functions:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:cost_per_sample}
    C_x(\TT) = -\sum_{t=1}^l \sum_{k=1}^K \II_{k=y} \mu_{t,k}.
\end{align}

\paragraph{Incorporating the Output Structures} 
This formulation of the cost function is equivalent to maximizing the
log-probability of the correct output sequence given an input sequence, where
the conditional log-probability is defined as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:log_y_x_seq}
    \log p(y|x) = \underbrace{\sum_{t=1}^l \underbrace{\log
    p(y_t|x_1,\ldots,x_t)}_{\text{Eq.~\eqref{eq:cost_per_step}}}}_{
        \text{Eq.~\eqref{eq:cost_per_sample}}}.
\end{align}
This means that the network is predicting the label of the $t$-th input symbol
using only the input symbols read up to that point (i.e., $x_1, x_2, \ldots,
x_t$.)

In other words, this means that the recurrent neural network is {\em not} taking
into account the structure of the output sequence. For instance, even without
looking at the input sequence, in English it is well known that the probability
of the next word being a noun increases if the current word is an
adjective.\footnote{
    Okay, this requires a more thorough analysis, but for the sake of the
    argument, which does not have to do anything with actual POS tags, let's
    believe that this is indeed the case.
} This kind of structures in the output are effectively ignored in this
formulation.

Why is this so in this formulation? Because, we have made an assumption that the
output symbols $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_l$ are mutually independent conditioned on
the input sequence. This is clear from Eq.~\eqref{eq:log_y_x_seq} and the
definition of the conditional independence:
\begin{align*}
    &\text{$Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are conditionally independent dependent on $X$} \\
    \iff&
    p(Y_1, Y_2|X) = p(Y_1|X)p(Y_2|x).
\end{align*}

If the underlying, true conditional distribution obeyed this assumption of
conditional independence, there is no worry. However, this is a very strong
assumption for many of the tasks we run into, apparently from the example of POS
tagging. Then, how can we exploit the structure in the output sequence?

One simple way is to make a less strong assumption about the conditional
probability of the output sequence $y$ given $x$. For instance, we can assume
that
\begin{align*}
    \log p(y|x) = \sum_{i=1}^l \log p(y_i|y_{<i}, x_{\leq i}),
\end{align*}
where $y_{<i}$ and $x_{\leq i}$ denote all the output symbols before the $i$-th one 
and all the input symbols up to the $i$-th one, respectively.

Now the question is how we can incorporate this into the existing formulation of
a recurrent neural network from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_h_x}. It turned out that the
answer is extremely simple. All we need to do is to compute the memory state of
the recurrent neural network based not only on the current input symbol $x_t$
and the previous memory state $\vh_{t-1}$, but also on the previous output
symbol $y_{t-1}$ such that
\begin{align*}
    \vh_t = f(x_t, y_{t-1}, \vh_{t-1}).
\end{align*}
Similarly to Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}, we can think of implementing $f$ as
\begin{align*}
    f(x_t, y_{t-1}, \vh_{t-1}) = g(\mW_x \phi_x(x_t) + \mW_y \phi_y(y_{t-1}) +
    \mW_h \vh_{t-1}).
\end{align*}

There are two questions naturally arising from this formulation. First, what do
we do when computing $\vh_1$? This is equivalent to saying what $\phi_y(y_{0})$
is. There are two potential answers to this question:
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item Fix $\phi_y(y_0)$ to an all-zero vector
    \item Consider $\phi_y(y_0)$ as an additional parameter
\end{enumerate}
In the latter case, $\phi_y(y_0)$ will be estimated together with all the other
parameters such as those weight matrices $\mW_x$, $\mW_y$, $\mW_h$ and $\mV$.

\paragraph{Inference}
The second question involves how to handle $y_{t-1}$. During training, it is
quite straightforward, as our cost function (KL-divergence between the
underlying, true distribution and the parametric conditional distribution
$p(y|x)$, approximated by Monte Carlo method) says that we use the groundtruth
value for $y_{t-1}$'s. 

It is however not clear what we should do when we test the trained network,
because then we are not given the groundtruth output sequence. This process of
finding an output that maximizes the conditional (log-)probability is called
{\em inference}\footnote{
    Okay, I confess. The term {\em inference} refers to a much larger class of
    problems, even if we consider only machine learning. However, let me simply
    use this term to refer to a task of finding the most likely output of a
    function.
}:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{y} = \argmax_y \log p(y|x)
\end{align*}

The exact inference is quite straightforward. One can simply evaluate $\log
p(y|x)$ for every possible output sequence and choose the one with the highest
conditional probability. Unfortunately, this is almost always intractable, as
the number of every possible output sequence grows exponentially with respect to
the length of the sequence:
\begin{align*}
    |\YY| = K^l,
\end{align*}
where $\YY$, $K$ and $l$ are the set of all possible output sequences, the
number of labels and the length of the sequence, respectively. Thus, this is
necessary to resort to approximate search over the set $\YY$.

The most naive approach to approximate inference is a greedy one. With the
trained model, you predict the first output symbol $\hat{y}_1$ based on the
first input symbol $x_1$ by selecting the category of the highest probability
$p(y_1|x_1)$. Now, given $\hat{y}_1$, $x_1$ and $x_2$, we compute
$p(y_2|x_1,x_2,y_1)$ from which we select the next output symbol $\hat{y}_2$
with the highest probability. We continue this process iteratively until the
last output symbol $\hat{y}_l$ is selected.

This is greedy in the sense that any early choice with a high conditional
probability may turn out to be unlikely one due to extremely low conditional
probabilities later on. It is highly related to the so-called {\em garden path
sentence} problem. To know more about this, read, for instance, Sec.~3.2.4 of
\cite{manning1999foundations}.

It is possible to alleviate this issue by considering $N<K$ best hypotheses of
the output sequence at each time step. This procedure is called {\em beam
search}, and we will discuss more about this in a later lecture on neural
machine translation.

%Now let us continue on to a much more interesting case of having a
%variable-length output $y$ whose length differs from that of the input sequence

\section{Gated Recurrent Units}

\subsection{Making Simple Recurrent Neural Networks {\em Realistic}}

Let us get back to the analogy we made in Sec.~\ref{sec:rnn}. We compared a
recurrent neural network to how CPU works. Executing a recurrent function $f$ is
equivalent to executing one of the instructions on CPU, and the memory state of
the recurrent neural network is equivalent to the registers of the CPU. This
analogy does sound plausible, except that it is not.

In fact, how a simple recurrent neural network works is far from being similar
to how CPU works. I am now talking about how they are implemented in practice,
but rather I'm talking at the conceptual level. What is it at the conceptual
level that makes the simple recurrent neural network unrealistic?

An important observation we make about the simple recurrent neural network is
that it {\em refreshes} the whole memory state at each time step. This is almost
opposite to how the registers on a CPU are maintained. Each time an instruction
is executed, the CPU does not clear up the whole registers and repopulate them.
Rather, it works only on a small number of registers. All the other registers'
values are stored as they were before the execution of the instruction.

Let's try to write this procedure mathematically. Each time, based on the choice
of instruction to be executed, a subset of the registers of a CPU, or a subset
of the elements in the memory state of a recurrent neural network, is selected.
This can be written down as a binary vector $\vu \in \left\{ 0, 1\right\}^{n_h}$:
\begin{align*}
    u_i = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{l l}
            0, & \text{ if the register's value does not change} \\
            1, & \text{ if the register's value will change}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}

With this binary vector, which I will call an {\em update gate}, a new memory
state or a new register value at time $t$ can be computed as a convex
interpolation such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:gru_leaky}
    \vh_{t} = (1 - \vu) \odot \vh_{t-1} + \vu \odot \tilde{\vh}_t,
\end{align}
where $\odot$ is as usual an element-wise multiplication. $\tilde{\vh}_t$
denotes a new memory state or a new register value, after executing the
instruction at time $t$.

Another unrealistic point about the simple recurrent neural network is that each
execution considers the whole registers. It is almost impossible to imagine
designing an instruction on a CPU that requires to read the values of all the
registers. Instead, what almost always happens is that each instruction will
consider only a small subset of the registers, which again we can use a binary
vector to represent. Let me call it a {\em reset gate} $\vr \in \left\{ 0,
1\right\}^{n_h}$:
\begin{align*}
    r_i = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{l l}
            0, & \text{ if the register's value will not be used} \\
            1, & \text{ if the register's value will be used}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}

This reset gate can be multiplied to the register values {\em before} being used
by the instruction at time $t$.\footnote{
    It is important to note that this is {\em not} resetting the actual values
    of the registers, but only the input to the instruction/recursive function.
} If we use a recursive function $f$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}, it means that
\begin{align} 
    \label{eq:gru_cand}
    \tilde{\vh}_t = f(x_t, \vr \odot \vh_{t-1}) = g(\mW \phi(x_t) + \mU (\vr
    \odot \vh_{t-1})).
\end{align}

Now, let us put these two gates that are necessary to make the simple recurrent
neural network more realistic into one piece. At each time step, the {\em
candidate} memory state is computed based on a subset of the elements of the
previous memory state:
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{\vh}_t = g(\mW \phi(x_t) + \mU (\vr \odot \vh_{t-1}))
\end{align*}
A new memory state is computed as a linear interpolation between the previous
memory state and this candidate memory state using the update gate:
\begin{align*}
    \vh_t = (1 - \vu) \odot \vh_{t-1} + \vu \odot \tilde{\vh}_t
\end{align*}
See Fig.~\ref{fig:gru} for the graphical illustration.

    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gated Recurrent Units}

Now here goes a big question: {\em How are the update $\vu$ and reset $\vr$
gates computed?}

If we stick to our analogy to the CPU, those gates must be pre-configured {\em
per instruction}. Those binary gates are dependent on the instruction. Again
however, this is not what we want to do in our case. There is no set of
predefined instructions, but the execution of any instruction corresponds to
computing a recurrent {\em function} based on the input symbol and the memory
state from the previous time step (see, e.g., Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}.)
Similarly to this what we want with the update and reset gates is that they are
computed by a function which depends on the input symbol and the previous memory
state.

This sounds like quite straightforward, except that we defined the gates to be
binary. This means that whatever the function we use to compute those gates, the
function will be a discontinuous function with zero derivative almost
everywhere, except at the point where a sharp transition from $0$ to $1$
happens. We discussed the consequence of having an activation function with zero
derivative almost everywhere in Sec.~\ref{sec:nonlinearities}, and the
conclusion was that it becomes very difficult to compute the gradient of the
cost function efficiently {\em and} exactly with these discrete activation
functions in a computational graph.

One simple solution which turned out to be extremely efficient is to consider
those gates not as binary vectors but as real-valued coefficient vectors. In
other words, we redefine the update and reset gates to be
\begin{align*}
    \vu \in \left[ 0, 1 \right]^{n_h}, \vr \in \left[ 0, 1\right]^{n_h}.
\end{align*}
This approach makes these gates {\em leaky} in the sense that they always allow
some leak of information through the gate.

In the case of the reset gate, rather than making a hard decision on which
subset of the registers, or the elements of the memory state, will be used, it
now decides {\em how much} information from the previous memory state will be
used. The update gate on the other hand now controls how much content in the
memory state will be replaced, which is equivalent to saying that it controls
how much information will be {\em kept} from the previous memory state.

Under this definition we can simply use a sigmoid function from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigmoid} to compute these gates:
\begin{align*}
    \vr =& \sigmoid(\mW_r \phi(x_t) + \mU_r \vh_{t-1}), \\
    \vu =& \sigmoid(\mW_u \phi(x_t) + \mU_u (\vr \odot \vh_{t-1})), \\
\end{align*}
where $\mW_r$, $\mU_r$, $\mW_u$ and $\mU_u$ are the additional
parameters.\footnote{
    Note that this is not {\em the} formulation available for computing the
    reset and update gates. For instance, one can use the following definitions
    of the reset and update gates:
    \begin{align*}
        \vr =& \sigmoid(\mW_r \phi(x_t) + \mU_r \vh_{t-1}), \\
        \vu =& \sigmoid(\mW_u \phi(x_t) + \mU_u \vh_{t-1}), \\
    \end{align*}
    which is more parallelizable than the original formulation from
    \cite{Cho-et-al-EMNLP2014}. This is because there is no more direct
    dependency between $\vr$ and $\vu$, which makes it possible to compute them
    in parallel.
}
Since
the sigmoid function is differentiable everywhere, we can use the
backpropagation algorithm (see Sec.~\ref{sec:autodiff}) to compute the
derivatives of the cost function with respect to these parameters and estimate
them together with all the other parameters.

We call this recurrent activation function with the reset and update gates a
{\em gated recurrent unit} (GRU), and a recurrent neural network having this GRU
as a gated recurrent network.

\paragraph{Long Short-Term Memory}

The gated recurrent unit (GRU) is highly motivated by a much earlier work on
long short-term memory (LSTM) units \cite{hochreiter1997long}.\footnote{
    Okay, let me confess here. I was not well aware of long short-term memory
    when I was designing the gated recurrent unit together with Yoshua Bengio
    and Caglar Gulcehre in 2014.
} The LSTM was proposed in 1997 with the goal of building a recurrent neural
network that can learn long-term dependencies across many number of timsteps,
which was deemed to be difficult to do so with a simple recurrent neural
network. 

Unlike the element-wise nonlinearity of the simple recurrent neural network and
the gated recurrent unit, the LSTM explicitly separates the memory state $\vc_t$
and the output $\vh_t$. The output is a small subset of the {\em hidden} memory
state, and only this subset of the memory state is visibly {\em exposed} to any
other part of the whole network. 

How does a recurrent neural network with LSTM units decide how much of the
memory state it will reveal?  As perhaps obvious at this point, the LSTM uses a
so-called {\em output} gate $\vo$ to achieve this goal. Similarly to the reset
and update gates of the GRU, the output gate is computed by
\begin{align*}
    \vo = \sigmoid(\mW_o \phi(x_t) + \mU_o \vh_{t-1}).
\end{align*}
This output vector is multiplied to the memory state $\vc_t$ point-wise to
result in the output:
\begin{align*}
    \vh_t = \vo \odot \tanh(\vc_t).
\end{align*}

Updating the memory state $\vc_t$ closely resembles how it is updated in the GRU
(see Eq.~\eqref{eq:gru_leaky}.) A major difference is that instead of using a
single update gate, the LSTM uses two gates, forget and input gates, such that
\begin{align*}
    \vc_t = \vf \odot \vc_{t-1} + \vi \odot \tilde{\vc}_t,
\end{align*}
where $\vf \in \RR^{n_h}$, $\vi \in \RR^{n_h}$ and $\tilde{\vc}_t$ are the
forget gate, input gate and the candidate memory state, respectively.

The roles of those two gates are quite clear from their names. The forget gate
decides how much information from the memory state will be {\em forgotten},
while the input gate controls how much informationa about the new input
(consisting of the input symbol and the previous output) will be {\em inputted}
to the memory. They are computed by
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:lstm_forget}
    \vf =& \sigmoid(\mW_f \phi(x_t) + \mU_f \vh_{t-1}), 
    \\
    \vi =& \sigmoid(\mW_i \phi(x_t) + \mU_i \vh_{t-1}).
    \nonumber
\end{align}

The candidate memory state is computed similarly to how it was done with the GRU
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:gru_cand}:
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{\vc}_t = g(\mW_c \phi(x_t) + \mU_c \vh_{t-1}),
\end{align*}
where $g$ is often an element-wise $\tanh$.

All the additional parameters specific to the
LSTM--$\mW_o,\mU_o,\mW_f,\mU_f,\mW_i,\mU_i,\mW_c$ and $\mU_c$-- are estimated
together with all the other parameters. Again, every function inside the LSTM is
differentiable everywhere, and we can use the backpropagation algorithm to
efficient compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to all the
parameters.

Although I have described one formulation of the long short-term memory unit
here, there are many other variants proposed over more than a decade since it
was first proposed. For instance, the forget gate in Eq.~\eqref{eq:lstm_forget}
was not present in the original work \cite{hochreiter1997long} but was fixed to
$1$. Gers et al. \cite{gers2000learning} proposed the forget gate few years
after the LSTM was originally proposed, and it turned out to be one of the most
crucial component in the LSTM. For more variants of the LSTM, I suggest you to
read \cite{greff2015lstm,jozefowicz2015empirical}.\footnote{
    Interestingly, based on the observation in \cite{jozefowicz2015empirical},
    it seems like the plain LSTM with a forget gate and the GRU seem to be close
    to the optimal gated unit we can find. 
}

\section{Why not Rectifiers?}

\subsection{Rectifiers Explode}
\label{sec:rect_explode}

Let us go back to the {\em simple recurrent neural network} which uses the
simple transformation layer from Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_layer}:
\begin{align*}
    f(x_t, \vh_{t-1}) = g(\mW \phi(x_t) + \mU \vh_{t-1}),
\end{align*}
where $g$ is an element-wise nonlinearity. 

One of the most widely used nonlinearities is a hyperbolic tangent function
$\tanh$. This is unlike the case in feedforward neural networks (multilayer
perceptrons) where a (unbounded) piecewise linear function, such as a rectifier
and maxout, has become standard. In the case of feedforward neural networks, you
can safely assume that everyone uses some kind of piecewise linear function as
an activation function in the network. This has become pretty much standard
since Krizhevsky et al. \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} shocked the (computer
vision) research community by outperforming all the more traditional computer
vision teams in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
2012.\footnote{
    \url{http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/results.html}
}

The main difference between logistic functions
($\tanh$ and sigmoid function) and piecewise linear functions (rectifiers and
maxout) is that the former is bounded from both above and below, while the
latter is bounded only from below (or in some cases, not bounded at all
\cite{he2015delving}.\footnote{
    A parametric rectifier, or PReLU, is defined as
    \begin{align*}
        g(x) = \left\{ 
            \begin{array}{l l}
                x, & \text{if }x \geq 0 \\
                ax, & \text{otherwise}
            \end{array}
            \right.,
    \end{align*}
    where $a$ is a parameter to be estimated together with all the other
    parameters of a network.
})

This unbounded nature of piece-wise linear functions makes it difficult for them
to be used in recurrent neural networks. Why is this so?

Let us consider the simplest case of unbounded element-wise nonlinearity; a
linear function:
\begin{align*}
    g(a) = a.
\end{align*}
%and sparse (i.e.
%$\sum_{t=1}^l \II_{\phi(x_t) \neq 0} = c$, where $c=O(1)$.) 

The hidden state after $l$ symbols is
\begin{align}
    \vh_l =& \mU(\mU (\mU (\mU (\cdots) + \mW\phi(x_{l-3})) + \mW\phi(x_{l-2})) +
    \mW\phi(x_{l-1})) + \mW\phi(x_l) 
    \nonumber
    \\
    =& \left(\prod_{l'=1}^{l-1} \mU\right) \mW\phi(x_{1})
    + \left(\prod_{l'=1}^{l-2} \mU\right) \mW\phi(x_{2})
    + \cdots 
    + \mU \mW \phi(x_{l-1}) 
    + \mW \phi(x_l), 
    \nonumber
    \\
    \label{eq:rnn_forward}
    =& \sum_{t=1}^l \underbrace{\left( \prod_{l'=1}^{l-t} \mU\right) \mW\phi(x_t)}_{(a)}
\end{align}
where $l$ is the length of the input sequence.

Let us assume that
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item $\mU$ is a full rank matrix
    \item The input sequence is sparse: $\sum_{t=1}^l \II_{\phi(x_t) \neq 0} =
        c$, where $c=O(1)$
    \item $\left[ \mW \phi(x) \right]_i > 0$ for all $i$
\end{itemize}
and consider Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_forward} (a):
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:rnn_forward_one}
    \vh_l^{t'} = \left( \prod_{l'=1}^{l-t'} \mU\right) 
    \mW\phi(x_{t'}).
\end{align}
%We will write $\vh_l$ by
%\begin{align}
%    \label{eq:approx_h}
%    \vh_l = c \underbrace{\left( \prod_{l'=1}^{l-t'} \mU\right) 
%    \mW\phi(x_{t'})}_{(a)},
%\end{align}
%where $x_{t'}$ is the last non-zero symbol in the input sequence, and
%$O(1)$ is an error in the approximation.

Now, let's look at what happens to Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_forward_one}. First, the
eigendecomposition of the matrix $\mU$:
\begin{align*}
    \mU = \mQ \mS \mQ^{-1},
\end{align*}
where $\mS$ is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero entries are eigenvalues.
$\mQ$ is an orthogonal matrix. Then
\begin{align*}
    \prod_{l'=1}^{l-t'} \mU = \mQ \mS^{l-t'} \mQ^{-1},
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
    \left(\prod_{l'=1}^{l-t'} \mU\right) \mW\phi(x_{t'})
    = \diag(\mS^{l-t'}) \odot (\underbrace{\mQ \mQ^{-1}}_{=\mI} \mW\phi(x_{t'})),
\end{align*}
where $\odot$ is an element-wise product.

What happens if the largest eigenvalue $e_{\max} = \max \diag(\mS)$ is larger
than $1$, the norm of $\vh_l$ will {\em explode}, i.e., $\|\vh_l\| \to \infty$.
Furthermore, due to the assumption that $\mW\phi(x_{t'}) > 0$, each element of
$\vh_l$ will explode to infinity as well. The rate of growth is exponentially
with respect to  the length of the input sequence, meaning that even when the
input sequence is not too long, the norm of the memory state grows quickly if
$e_{\max}$ is reasonably larger than $1$. 

This happens, because the nonlinearity $g$ is {\em unbounded}. If $g$ is bounded
from both above and below, such as the case with $\tanh$, the norm of the memory
state is also bounded. In the case of $\tanh:\RR \to \left[ -1, 1\right]$,
\begin{align*}
    \|\vh_l\|\leq \dim(\vh_l).
\end{align*}

This is one reason why a logistic function, such as $\tanh$ and $\sigmoid$, is
most widely used with recurrent neural networks, compared to piecewise linear
functions.\footnote{
    However, it is not to say that piecewise linear functions are never used for
    recurrent neural networks. See, for instance,
    \cite{le2015simple,bengio2013advances}.
} I will call this recurrent neural network with $\tanh$ as an element-wise
nonlinear function a {\em simple recurrent neural network}. 

\subsection{Is $\tanh$ a Blessing?}
\label{sec:vanishing_grad}

Now, the argument in the previous section may sound like $\tanh$ and $\sigmoid$
are {\em the} nonlinear functions that one should use. This seems quite
convincing for recurrent neural networks, and perhaps so for feedforward neural
networks as well, if the network is {\em deep} enough.

Here let me try to convince you otherwise by looking at how the norm of
backpropagated derivative behaves. Again, this is much easier to see if we
assume the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item $\mU$ is a full rank matrix
    \item The input sequence is sparse: $\sum_{t=1}^l \II_{\phi(x_t) \neq 0} =
        c$, where $c=O(1)$
\end{itemize}

Similarly to Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_forward}, let us consider a forward computational
path until $\vh_l$, however without assuming a linear activation function:
\begin{align*}
    \vh_l = g\left(\mU g\left(\mU g\left(\mU g\left(\mU \left( \cdots \right)
                + \mW \phi\left(x_{l-3}\right)\right) + \mW
        \phi\left(x_{l-2}\right)\right)+\mW \phi\left(x_{l-1}\right)\right) +
    \mW\phi\left(x_{l}\right)\right).
\end{align*}
We will consider a subsequence of this process, in which all the input symbols
are $0$ except for the first symbol:
\begin{align*}
    \vh_{l_1} = g\left(\mU g\left(\mU \left( \cdots g\left(\mU \vh_{l_0} + \mW
    \phi\left(x_{l_0+1}\right)\right)\right)\right)\right).
\end{align*}
It should be noted that as $l$ approaches
infinity, there will be at least one such subsequence whose length also
approaches infinity due to the sparsity of the input we assumed.

From this equation, let's look at 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \phi\left(x_{l_0+1}\right)}.
\end{align*}
This measures the effect of the $(l_0+1)$-th input symbol $x_{l_0+1}$ on the
$l_1$-th memory state of the simple recurrent neural network. This is also the
crucial derivative that needs to be computed in order to compute the gradient of
the cost function using the automated backpropagation procedure described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:autodiff}.

This derivative can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \phi\left(x_{l_0+1}\right)} = 
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial
    \vh_{l_0+1}}}_{(a)}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_0+1}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_0+1}}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_0+1}}{\partial
    \phi\left(x_{l_0+1}\right)}.
\end{align*}
Among these three terms in the left hand side, we will focus on the first one
(a) which can be further expanded as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:tderiv}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \vh_{l_0+1}} = 
    \left(
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_1}}}_{(b)}
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_1}}{\partial \vh_{l_1-1}}}_{(c)}
\right)
\left(
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial \vh_{l_1-1}}{\partial
    \underline{\vh}_{l_1-1}}}_{(b)}
        \underbrace{\frac{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_1-1}}{\partial
        \vh_{l_1-2}}}_{(c)}
\right)
    \cdots
\left(
    \underbrace{\frac{\partial \vh_{l_0+2}}{\partial
    \underline{\vh}_{l_0+2}}}_{(b)}
        \underbrace{\frac{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_0+2}}{\partial
        \vh_{l_0+1}}}_{(c)}
    \right).
\end{align}

Because this is a recurrent neural network, we can see that the analytical forms
for the terms grouped by the parentheses in the above equation are identical
except for the subscripts indicating the time index. In other words, we can
simply only on one of those groups, and the resulting analytical form will be
generally applicable to all the other groups.

First, we look at Eq.~\eqref{eq:tderiv} (b), which is nothing but a derivative
of a nonlinear activation function used in this simple recurrent neural network.
The derivatives of the widely used logistic functions are 
\begin{align*}
    \sigma'(x) =& \sigma(x) (1 - \sigma(x)), \\
    \tanh'(x) =& 1 - \tanh^2(x),
\end{align*}
as described earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:nonlinearities}. 
Both of these functions' derivatives are {\em bounded}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sigmoid_bound}
    &0 < \sigma'(x) \leq 0.25, \\
    \label{eq:tanh_bound}
    &0 < \tanh'(x) \leq 1.
\end{align}

In the simplest case in which $g$ is a linear function (i.e., $x=g(x)$,) we do
not even need to look at $\left\| \frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial
\underline{\vh}_{t}} \right\|$. We simply ignore all the $\frac{\partial
\vh_t}{\partial \underline{\vh}_t}$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:tderiv}.

Next, consider Eq.~\eqref{eq:tderiv} (c). In this case of simple recurrent
neural network, we notice that we have already learned how to compute this
derivative earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:example2}:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t+1}}{\partial \vh_{t}} = \mU
\end{align*}

From these two, we get
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \vh_{l_0+1}} =&
    \left(
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_1}}
    \mU
\right)
\left(
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1-1}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_1-1}}
    \mU
\right)
    \cdots
\left(
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_0+2}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{l_0+2}}
    \mU
    \right) 
    \\
    =& \prod_{t=l_0+2}^{l_1} \left( \frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial
\underline{\vh}_{t}} \mU\right).
\end{align*}

Do you see how similar it looks like Eq.~\eqref{eq:rnn_forward_one}? If the recurrent
activation function $f$ is linear, this whole term reduces to
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \vh_{l_0+1}} = \mU^{l_1-l_0+1},
\end{align*}
which according to Sec.~\ref{sec:rect_explode}, will explode as $l\to\infty$ if
\begin{align*}
    e_{\max} > 1,
\end{align*}
where $e_{\max}$ is the largest eigenvalue of $\mU$. When $e_{\max} < 1$, it
will {\em vanish}, i.e., $\|\frac{\partial \vh_{l_1}}{\partial \vh_{l_0+1}}\|
\to 0$, exponentially fast.

What if the recurrent activation function $f$ is {\em not} linear at all? Let's
look at $\frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t}} \mU$ as 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t}} \mU = 
        \underbrace{
    \left[ 
            \begin{array}{c c c c}
                f_1' & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
                0 & f_2' & \cdots & 0 \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\
                0 & 0 & \cdots & f_{n_h}'
            \end{array}
    \right] 
        }_{=\diag\left( \frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t}}\right)}
    \left(\mQ \mS \mQ^{-1}\right),
\end{align*}
where we used the eigendecomposition of $\mU=\mQ \mS \mQ^{-1}$. This can be
re-written into
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t}} \mU = 
    \mQ \left( \diag\left(\frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial
            \underline{\vh}_{t}}\right)
    \odot \mS \right) \mQ^{-1}.
\end{align*}
This means that the eigenvalue of $\mU$ will be scaled by the derivative of the
recurrent activation function at each timestep. In this case, we can bound the
maximum eigenvalue of $\frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial \underline{\vh}_{t}}
\mU$ by
\begin{align*}
    e_{\max}^t \leq \lambda e_{\max},
\end{align*}
where $\lambda$ is the upperbound on $g'=\frac{\partial \vh_{t}}{\partial
\underline{\vh}_{t}}$. See Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sigmoid_bound}--\eqref{eq:tanh_bound}
for the upperbounds of the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions.

In other words, if the largest eigenvalue of $\mU$ is larger than
$\frac{1}{\lambda}$, it is {\em likely} that this temporal derivative of
$\vh_{l_1}$ with respect to $\vh_{l_0+1}$ will {\em explode}, meaning that its
norm will grow exponentially large. In the opposite case of $e_{\max} <
\frac{1}{\lambda}$, the norm of the temporal derivative likely shrinks toward
$0$. The former case is referred to as {\em exploding gradient}, and the latter
{\em vanishing gradient}. These cases were studied already at the very early
years of research in recurrent neural
networks~\cite{bengio1994learning,hochreiter2001gradient}.

Using $\tanh$ is a blessing in recurrent neural networks when running the
network forward, as I described in the previous section. This is however not
necessarily true in the case of backpropagating derivaties. Especially because, 
there is a higher chance of vanishing gradient with $\tanh$, or even worse with
$\sigmoid$. Why? Because $\frac{1}{\lambda} > 1$ for almost everywhere.

\subsection{Are We Doomed?}
\label{sec:rnn_vanish_grad}

\paragraph{Exploding Gradient}

Fortunately it turned out that the phenomenon of exploding gradient is quite
easy to address. First, it is straightforward to detect whether the exploding
gradient happened by inspecting the norm of the gradient fo the cost with
respect to the parameters $\left\| \nabla_{\TT} \tilde{C} \right\|$. If the
gradient's norm is larger than some predefined threhold $\tau > 0$, we can
simply renormalize the norm of the gradient to be $\tau$. Otherwise, we leave it
as it is.

In mathematics,
\begin{align*}
    \tilde{\nabla} = 
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            \tau \frac{\nabla}{\|\nabla\|}, & \text{ if } \|\nabla\| > \tau \\
            \nabla, & \text{ otherwise}
        \end{array}
    \right.,
\end{align*}
where we used the shorthand notiation $\nabla$ for $\nabla_{\TT} \tilde{C}$.
$\tilde{\nabla}$ is a rescaled gradient update direction which will be used by
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm from Sec.~\ref{sec:sgd}. This
algorithm is referred to as {\em gradient clipping}
\cite{pascanu2013difficulty}.

\paragraph{Vanishing Gradient}

What about vanishing gradient? But, first, what does vanishing gradient mean? We
need to understand the meaning of this phenomenon in order to tell whether this
is a problem at all from the beginning.

Let us consider a case the variable-length output where $|x|=|y|$ from
Sec.~\ref{sec:rnn_x_y}. Let's assume that there exists a clear dependency
between the output label $y_t$ and the input symbol $x_{t'}$, where $t' \ll t$.
This means that the empirical cost will decrease when the weights are adjusted
such that 
\[
    \log p(y_t=y_t^*| \ldots, \phi(x_{t'}), \ldots)
\]
is maximized, where $y_t^*$ is the ground truth output label at time $t$. The
value of $\phi(x_{t'})$ has great influence on the $t$-th output $y_t$, and the
influence can be measured by 
\[ 
    \frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*| \ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})}.
\]

Instead of exactly computing $\frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*| \ldots)}{\partial
\phi(x_{t'})}$, we can approximate it by the finite difference method. Let
$\epsilon \in \RR^{\dim(\phi(x_{t'}))}$ be a vector of which each element is a
very small real value ($\epsilon \approx 0$.) Then,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})} 
    = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}& \left(\log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots,
    \phi(x_{t'})+\epsilon, \ldots)
    \right.
    \\
&- \left. \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots, \phi(x_{t'}), \ldots, )\right) \oslash \epsilon,
\end{align*}
where $\oslash$ is an element-wise division.  This shows that $\frac{\partial
\log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})}$ computes the difference in the
$t$-th output probability with respect to the change in the value of the $t'$-th
input. 

In other words $\frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})}$
directly reflects the degree to which the $t$-th output $y_t$ {\em depends} on
the $t'$-th input $x_{t'}$, {\em according to the network}.  To put it in
another way, $\frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial\phi(x_{t'})}$
reflects how much dependency the {\em recurrent neural network has captured the
dependency between $y_t$ and $x_{t'}$}.

Let's rewrite 
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})} 
    = \frac{\partial \log p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \vh_t}
    \underbrace{
        \frac{\partial \vh_t}{\partial \vh_{t-1}} \cdots
        \frac{\partial \vh_{t'+1}}{\partial \vh_{t'}} 
    }_{(a)}
    \frac{\partial \vh_{t'}}{\partial \phi(x_t)}.
\end{align*}
The terms marked with (a) looks exactly identical to Eq.~\eqref{eq:tderiv}. We
have already seen that this term can easily {\em vanish} toward zero with a high
probability (see Sec.~\ref{sec:vanishing_grad}.)

This means that the recurrent neural network is unlikely to capture this
dependency. This is especially true when the (temporal) distance between the
output and input, i.e., $|t - t'| \gg 0$.

The biggest issue with this vanishing behaviour is that there is no
straightforward way to avoid it. We cannot tell whether $\frac{\partial \log
p(y_t=y_t^*|\ldots)}{\partial \phi(x_{t'})} \approx 0$ is due to the lack of
this dependency in the true, underlying function or due to the wrong
configuration (parameter setting) of the recurrent neural network. If we are
certain that there are indeed these long-term dependencies, we may
simultaneously minimize the following auxiliary term together with the cost
function:
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{t=1}^T \left( 1 - \frac{\left\| 
            \frac{\partial \tilde{C}}{\partial \vh_{t+1}}
            \frac{\partial \vh_{t+1}}{\partial \vh_t}
    \right\|}{\left\| 
        \frac{\partial \tilde{C}}{\partial \vh_{t+1}}
\right\|} \right)^2.
\end{align*}
This term, which was introduced in \cite{pascanu2013difficulty}, is minimized
when the norm of the derivative does not change as it is being backpropagated,
effectively forcing the gradient {\em not} to vanish.

This term however was found to help significantly only when the target task, or
the underlying function, does indeed exhibit long-term dependencies. How can we
know in advance? Pascanu et al. \cite{pascanu2013difficulty} showed this with
the well-known toy tasks which were specifically designed to exhibit long-term
dependencies \cite{hochreiter2001gradient}.


\subsection{Gated Recurrent Units Address Vanishing Gradient}

Will the same problems of vanishing gradient happen with the gated recurrent
units (GRU) or the long short-term memory units (LSTM)? Let us write the memory 
state at time $t$:
\begin{align*}
    \vh_t =& \vu_t \odot \tilde{\vh}_t + 
    (1 - \vu_t) \odot \left(
        \vu_{t-1} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-1} + 
        (1 - \vu_{t-1}) \odot \left(
            \vu_{t-2} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-2} + 
            (1 - \vu_{t-2}) \odot \left(
                \cdots
            \right)
        \right)
    \right) 
    \\
    =& \vu_t \odot \tilde{\vh}_t +
    (1-\vu_t) \odot \vu_{t-1} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-1} +
    (1-\vu_t) \odot (1-\vu_{t-1}) \odot \vu_{t-2} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-2} +
    \cdots
\end{align*}
Let's be more specific and see what happens to this with respect to $x_{t'}$:
\begin{align}
    \vh_t =& \vu_t \odot \tilde{\vh}_t +
    (1-\vu_t) \odot \vu_{t-1} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-1} +
    (1-\vu_t) \odot (1-\vu_{t-1}) \odot \vu_{t-2} \odot \tilde{\vh}_{t-2} +
    \cdots 
    \nonumber \\
    \label{eq:gru_expand}
    & +
    \underbrace{
        \left(\prod_{k=t,\ldots,t'+1} (1-\vu_k)\right) \odot \vu_{t'} 
    }_{(a)}
    \odot \tanh \left( \mW \phi(x_{t'}) + \mU \left( \vr_{t'} \odot \vh_{t'-1} \right)
    \right),
\end{align}
where $\prod$ is for element-wise multiplication.

What this implies is that the GRU effectively introduces a {\em shortcut} from
time $t'$ to $t$. The change in $x_{t'}$ will directly influence the value of
$\vh_t$, and subsequently the $t$-th output symbol $y_t$. In other words, all
the issue with the simple recurrent neural network we discussed earlier in
Sec.~\ref{sec:rnn_vanish_grad}.

The update gate controls the strength of these shortcuts. Let's assume for now
that the update gate is fixed to some predefined value between $0$ and $1$. This
effectively makes the GRU a leaky integration unit \cite{bengio2013advances}.
However, as it is perhaps clear from Eq.~\eqref{eq:gru_expand} that we will
inevitably run into an issue. Why is this so? 

Let's say we are sure that there are many long-term dependencies in the data.
It is natural to choose a large coefficient for the leaky integration unit,
meaning the update gate is close to $1$. This will definitely help carrying the
dependency across many time steps, but this inevitably carries {\em unnecessary}
information as well. This means that much of the representational power of the
output function $g_{\text{out}}(\vh_t)$ is wasted in {\em ignoring} those
unnecessary information.

If the update gate is fixed to something substantially smaller than $1$, all the
shortcuts (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:gru_expand} (a)) will exponentially vanish. Why?
Because it is a repeated multiplication of a scalar small than 1. In other
words, it does not really help to have a leaky integration unit in the place of
a simple $\tanh$ unit.

This is however not the case with the actual GRU or LSTM, because those update
gates are {\em not} fixed but are adaptive with respect to the input. If the
network detects that there is an important dependency being captured, the update
gate will be closed ($u_j \approx 0$.) This will effectively strengthen the
shortcut connection (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:gru_expand} (a).) When the network
detects that there is no dependency anymore, it will open the update gate ($u_j
\approx 1$), which effectively cuts off the shortcut. How does the network know,
or detect, the existence or lack of these dependencies? Do we need to manually
code this up? I will leave these questions for you to figure out.


\chapter{Neural Language Models}

\section{Language Modeling: First Step}

What does it mean for a machine to understand natural language? In other words,
how can we tell that the machine understood natural language?  These are the two
equivalent questions that are at the core of this course. 

One of the most basic capability of a machine that can signal us that it indeed
understands natural language is for the machine to tell how likely a given
sentence is. Of course, this is extremely ill-defined, as we probably cannot
define the {\em likeliness} of a sentence, because there are many different
types of unlikeliness. For instance, a sentence ``Colorless green ideas sleep
furiously'' from Chomsky's \cite{chomsky2002syntactic} is {\em unlikely}
according to our common sense, because 
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item An object (``idea'') cannot be both ``colorless'' and ``green.''
    \item An object cannot ``sleep'' ``furiously.''
    \item An ``idea'' does not ``sleep.''
\end{enumerate}
On the other hand, this sentence is a grammatically correct sentence.

Let's take a look at another sentence ``Jane and me went to see a movie
yesterday.'' Grammatically, this is not the most correct sentence one can make.
It should be ``Jane and I went to see a movie yesterday.'' Even with a
grammatical error in the original sentence however, the meaning of the sentence
is clear to me, and perhaps is much more understandable than the sentence
``colorless green ideas sleep furiously.'' Furthermore, many people likely say
this (saying ``me'' instead of ``I'') quite often. This sentence is thus likely
according to our common sense, but is not likely according to the grammar.

This observation makes us wonder what is the criterion to use. Is it correct for
a machine to tell whether the sentence is likely by analyzing its grammatical
correctness? Or, is it possible that the machine should deem a sentence likely
only when its meaning agrees well with common sense regardless of its
grammatical correctness in the most strict sense?

As we discussed in the first lecture of the course, we are more interested in
approaching natural language as a means for one to communicate ideas to a
listener. In this sense, language use is a function which takes as input the
surrounding environment, including the others' speech, and returns linguistic
response, and this function is {\em not} given but learned via observing others'
use of language (\alert{TBD: some citation on baby's language learning}) and the
reinforcement by the surrounding environment~\cite{skinner2014verbal}. Also,
throughout this course, we are not concerned too much about the existing
syntactic, or grammatical, structures underlying natural language, which makes
it difficult for us to say anything about the grammatical correctness of a given
sentence.

In short, we take the route here that the likeliness of a sentence be determined
based on its agreement with common sense. The common sense here is captured by
everyday use of natural language, which consequently implies that the statistics
of natural language use can be a strong indicator for determining the likely of
a natural language sentence. 

\subsection{What if those linguistic structures do exist}

Of course, as we discussed earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:wrong_route} and in this
section, not everyone agrees.  This is due to the fact that a perfect
grammatical sentence may be considered unlikely, just because it does not happen
often. In other words, statistical approaches to {\em language modeling} may
conclude that a sentence with perfectly valid grammatical construction is
unlikely. Is this a problem? 

This problem of telling how likely a given sentence is can be viewed very
naturally as building a probabilistic model of sentences. In other words, given
a sentence $S$, what is the probability $p(S)$ of $S$?  Let us briefly talk
about what this means for the case of viewing the likeliness of a sentence as
equivalent to its grammatical correctness.\footnote{
    Why briefly and why here? Because, we will not pursue this line at all after
    this section.
}

We first assume that there is an underlying linguistic structure $G$ which has
generated the observed sentence $S$. Of course, we do not know the correct $G$
in advance, and unfortunately no one will tell us what the correct $G$
is.\footnote{
    Here, the correct $G$ means the $G$ that generated $S$, not the whole
    structure of $G$ which is assumed to exist according to a certain set of
    rules.
}
Thus,
$G$ is a hidden variable in this case. This hidden structure $G$ generates the
observed sentence $S$ according to an unknown conditional distribution $p(S|G)$.
Each and every grammatical structure $G$ is assigned a prior probability which
is also unknown in advance.\footnote{
    This is not necessarily true. If we believe that each and every grammatical
    correct sentence is equally likely and that each correct grammatical
    structure generates a single corresponding sentence, the prior distribution
    over the hidden linguistic structure is such that any correct structure is
    given an equal probability while any incorrect structure is given a zero
    probability. But, of course, if we think about it, there are clearly certain
    structures that are more prevalent and others that are not.
}

With the conditional distribution $S|G$ and the prior distribution $G$, we
easily get the joint distribution $S,G$ by
\begin{align*}
    p(S,G) = p(S|G) p(G),
\end{align*}
from the definition of conditional probability.\footnote{
    A conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is defined as
    \begin{align*}
        p(A|B) = \frac{p(A, B)}{p(B)}
    \end{align*}
} 
From this joint distribution we get the distribution over a given sentence $S$
by marginalizing out $G$:
\begin{align*}
    p(S) = \sum_{G} p(S, G).
\end{align*}
This means that we should compute how likely a given sentence $S$ is with
respect to all possible underlying linguistic structure. This is very likely
intractable, because there must be infinite possible such structures.

Instead of computing $p(S)$ exactly we can simply look at its lowerbound. For
instance, one simplest, and probably not the best, way to do so is
\begin{align*}
    p(S) = \sum_G p(S,G) \geq p(S, \hat{G}),
\end{align*}
where $\hat{G} = \argmax_G p(S,G) = \argmax_G p(G|S)$.\footnote{
    This inequality holds due to the definition of probability, which states
    that $p(X)\geq 0$ and $\sum_X p(X) = 1$.
}

This lowerbound is tight, i.e., $p(S) = p(S, \hat{G})$, when there is only a
single true underlying linguistic structure $\hat{G}$ given $S$. What this says
is that there is no other possible linguistic structure possible for a single
observed sentence, i.e., no ambiguity in inferring the correct linguistic
structure.  In other words, we can compute the probability or likeliness of a
given sentence by inferring its correct underlying linguistic structure.

However, there are a few issues here. First, it is not clear which formalism $G$
follows, and we have briefly discussed about this at the very beginning of this
course. Second, it is quite well known that most of the formalisms do indeed
have uncertainty in inference. Again, we looked at one particular example in
Sec.~\cite{sec:language_understanding_wrong}. These two issues make many people,
including myself, quite uneasy about this type of {\em model-based} approaches. 

In the remaining of this chapter, I will thus talk about model-free approaches
(as opposed to these model-based approaches.)

\subsection{Quick Note on Linguistic Units}

Before continuing, there is one question that must be bugging you, or at least
has bugged me a lot: {\em what is the minimal linguistic unit?} 

If we think about written text, the minimal unit does seem like a character.
With spoken language, the minimal unit seems to be a phoneme. But, is this the
level at which we want to model the process of {\em understanding} natural
language? In fact, to most of the existing natural language processing
researchers as well as some (or most) linguists, the answer to this question is
a hard ``no.''

The main reason is that these low-level units, both characters and phonemes, do
not convey any meaning themselves. Does a Latin alphabet ``q'' have its own
meaning? The answer by most of the people will be ``no.'' Then, starting from
this alphabet ``q'', how far should we climb up in the hierarchy of linguistic
units to reach a level at which the unit begins to convey its own meaning?
``qu'' does not seem to have its own meaning still. ``qui'' in French means
``who'', but in English it does not really say much. ``quit'' in English is a
valid word that has its own meaning, and similarly ``quiet'' is a valid word
that has its own meaning, quite apart from that of ``quit.''

It looks like a word is the level at which meaning begins to form itself.
However, this raises a follow-up question on the definition of a word: {\em What
is a word?}

It is tempting to say that a sequence of non-blank characters is a word. This
makes everyone's life so much easier, because we can simply split each sentence
by a blank space to get a sequence of words. Unfortunately this is a very bad
strategy. The simplest counter example to this definition of words is a token
(which I will use to refer to a sequence of non-blank characters) consisting of
a word followed by a punctuation. If we simply split a sentence into words by
blank spaces, we will get a bunch of redundant words. For instance, ``llama'',
``llama,'', ``llama.'', ``llama?'', ``"llama'', ``llama"'' and ``llama!'' will
all be distinct words. We will run into an issue of exploding vocabulary with
any morphologically rich language. Furthermore, in some languages such as
Chinese, there is no blank space at all inside a sentence, in which case this
simple strategy will completely fail to give us any meaningful, small linguistic
unit other than sentences.

Now at this point it almost seems like the best strategy is to use each
character as a linguistic unit. This is not necessarily true due to the highly
nonlinear nature of orthography.\footnote{
    Orthography is defined as ``the study of spelling and how letters combine to
    represent sounds and form words.''
} There are many examples in which this nonlinear nature shows its difficulty.
One such example is to consider the following three words: ``quite'', ``quiet''
and ``quit''.\footnote{
    I would like to thank Bart van Merrienboer for this example.
}
All three character sequences have near identical forms, but their corresponding
meanings differ from each other substantially. In other words, any function that
maps from these character sequences to the corresponding meanings will have to
be extremely nonlinear and thus difficult to be learned from data. Of course,
this is an area with active research, and I hope I am not giving you an
impression that characters are not the units to use (see, e.g.,
\cite{kim2015character}.)

Now then the question is whether there is some middle ground between characters
and words (or blank-space-separated tokens) that are more suitable to be used as
elementary linguistic units (see, e.g., \cite{sennrich2015neural}.)
Unfortunately this is again an area with active research.  Hopefully, we will
have time later in the course to discuss this issue further.  For now, we will
simply use blank-space-separated tokens as our linguistic units.

\section{Statistical Language Modeling}
\label{sec:lm}

Regardless of which linguistic unit we use, any natural language sentence $S$
can be represented as a sequence of $T$ discrete symbols such that
\begin{align*}
    S = (w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_T).
\end{align*}
Each symbol is one element from a {\em vocabulary} $V$ which contains all
possible symbols:
\begin{align*}
    V = \left\{ v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|V|}\right\},
\end{align*}
where $|V|$ is used to mean the size of the vocabulary, or the number of all
symbols.

The problem of language modeling is equivalent to finding a model that assigns a
probability $p(S)$ to a sentence:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sentence_prob}
    p(S) = p(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_T).
\end{align}
Of course, we are not given this distribution and need to learn this from data.

Let's say we are given data $D$ which contains $N$ sentences such that
\begin{align*}
    D = \left\{ S^1, S^2, \ldots, S^N \right\},
\end{align*}
where each sentence $S^n$ is 
\begin{align*}
    S^n = (w_1^n, w_2^n, \ldots, w_{T^n}^n),
\end{align*}
meaning that each sentence has a different length.

Given this data $D$, let us estimate the probability of a certain sentence $S$.
This is quite straightforward:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sentence_mle}
    p(S) = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N \II_{S = S^n}}{N},
\end{align}
where $\II$ is the indicator function defined earlier in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:indicator_function} which is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \II_{S=S^n} = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{c c}
            1, & \text{if }S=S^n \\
            0, & \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}
This is equivalent to counting how many times $S$ occurs in the data.\footnote{
    A data set consisting of (written) text is often referred to as a {\em
    corpus}. 
}

\subsection{Data Sparsity}
\label{sec:data_sparsity}

Has this solved the whole problem of language model? No, unfortunately not. The
very major issue here is that however large your corpus is, it is unlikely to
contain all reasonable sentences in the world. Let's do simple counting here.

There are $|V|$ symbols in a vocabulary. Each sentence can be as long as $T$
symbols. Then, there are $|V|^T$ possible sentences. A reasonable range for the
sentence length $T$ is roughly between $1$ to $50$, meaning that there are
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{T=1}^{50} |V|^T
\end{align*}
possible sentences. As it's quite clear, this is a huge space of sentences.

Of course, not all those sentences are plausible. This is however conceivable
that even the fraction of that space will be gigantic, especially considering
that the size of vocabulary often goes up to $100$k to 1M words. Many of the
plausible sentences will not appear in the corpus. Is this true? In fact, yes,
it is. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/llama_lying_down.jpg}
    \caption{A picture of a llama lying down. From
    \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama}}
    \label{fig:llama}
\end{figure}

It is quite easy to find such an example. For instance, Google Books Ngram
Viewer\footnote{
    \url{https://books.google.com/ngrams}
}
lets you search for a sentence or a sequence of up to five English words from
the gigantic corpus of Google Books. Let me try to search for a very plausible
sentence ``I like llama,'' and the Google Books Ngram\footnote{
    We will discuss what Ngrams are in the later sections.
} 
Viewer returns an error
saying that ``Ngrams not found: I like llama.'' (see Fig.~\ref{fig:llama} in the case you
are not familiar with a llama.) See Fig.~\ref{fig:ngram_fail} as an evidence.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ngram_fail.png}
    \caption{A resulting page of Google Books Ngram Viewer for the query ``I
    like llama''.}
    \label{fig:ngram_fail}
\end{figure}

What does this mean for the estimate in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sentence_mle}? It means
that this estimator will be too harsh for many of the plausible sentences that
do not occur in the data. As soon as a given sentence does not appear {\em
exactly} as it is in the corpus, this estimator will say that there is a {\em
zero} probability of the given sentence. Although the sentence ``I like llama''
is a likely sentence, according to this estimator in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:sentence_mle}, it will be deemed extremely unlikely.

This problem is due to the issue of {\em data sparsity}. Data sparsity here
refers to the phenomenon where a training set does not cover the whole space of
input sufficiently. In more concrete terms, most of the points in the input
space, which have non-zero probabilities according to the true, underlying
distribution, do not appear in the training set. If the size of a training set
is assumed to be fixed, the severity of data sparsity increases as the average,
or maximum length of the sentences. This follows from the fact that the size of
the input space, the set of all possible sentences, grows with respect to the
maximum possible length of a sentence.

In the next section, we will discuss the most straightforward approach to
addressing this issue of data sparsity.

\section{$n$-Gram Language Model}

The fact that the issue of data sparsity worsens as the maximum length of
sentences grows hints us a straightforward approach to addressing this: {\em
limit the maximum length of phrases/sentences we estimate a probability on}.
This idea is a foundation on which a so-called $n$-gram language model is based.

In the $n$-gram language model, we first rewrite the probability of a given
sentence $S$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:sentence_prob} into
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:unidir_sentence}
    p(S) = p(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_T) = p(w_1)p(w_2|w_1)\cdots
    \underbrace{p(w_k|w_{<k})}_{(a)}
    \cdots p(w_T|w_{<T}),
\end{align}
where $w_{<k}$ denotes all the symbols before the $k$-th symbol $w_k$. From
this, the $n$-gram language model makes an important assumption that each
conditional probability (Eq.~\eqref{eq:unidir_sentence}~(a)) is only conditioned
on the $n-1$ preceding symbols only, meaning
\begin{align*}
    p(w_k | w_{<k}) \approx p(w_k | w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w_{k-1}).
\end{align*}
This results in 
\begin{align*}
    p(S) \approx \prod_{t=1}^T p(w_t | w_{t-n}, \ldots, w_{t-1}).
\end{align*}

What does this mean? Under this assumption we are saying that any symbol in a
sentence is {\em predictable} based on the $n-1$ preceding symbols. This is in
fact a quite reasonable assumption in many languages. For instance, let us
consider a phrase ``I am from''. Even without any more context information
surrounding this phrase, such as surrounding words and the identity of a
speaker, we know that the word following this phrase will be likely a name of
place or country. In other words, the probability of a name of place or country
given the three preceding words ``I am from'' is higher than that of any other
words. 

But, of course, this assumption does not always work. For instance, consider a
phrase ``In Korea, more than half of all the residents speak
$\underbrace{\text{Korean}}_{(a)}$.'' Let us focus on the last word ``Korean''
(marked with (a).) We immediately see that it will be useful to condition its
conditional probability on the second word ``Korea''. Why is this so? Because
the conditional probability of ``Korean'' following ``speak'' should
significantly increase over all the other words (that correspond to other
languages) knowing the fact that the sentence is talking about the residents of
``Korea''. This requires the conditional distribution to be conditioned on at
least 10 words (``,'' is considered a separate word,) and this certainly will
not be captured by $n$-gram language model with $n < 9$.  

From these examples it is clear that there's a natural trade-off between the
quality of probability estimate and statistical efficiency based on the choice
of $n$ in $n$-gram language modeling. The higher $n$ the longer context the
conditional distribution has, leading to a better model/estimate (second
example,) however resulting in a situation of more sever data sparsity (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:data_sparsity}.) On the other hand, the lower $n$ leads to the
worse language modeling (second example), but this will avoid the issue of data
sparsity. 

\paragraph{$n$-gram Probability Estimation}

We can estimate the $n$-gram conditional probability $p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots,
w_{k-1})$ from the training corpus.
Since it is a
{\em conditional} probability, we need to rewrite it according to the definition
of the conditional probability:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:n_gram_prob}
    p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = \frac{p(
    w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k)}
    {p(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})}
\end{align}
This rewrite implies that the $n$-gram probability is equivalent to counting
the occurrences of the $n$-gram $(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k})$
among all $n$-grams starting with $(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})$.

Let us consider the denominator first. The denominator can be computed by the
marginalizing the $k$-th word ($w'$ below):
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:n_gram_marginal}
    p(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = \sum_{w'\in V} p(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w').
\end{align}
From Eq.~\eqref{eq:sentence_mle}, we know how to estimate $p(w_{k-n}, \ldots,
w_{k-1}, w')$:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:n_gram_expand}
    p(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w') \approx \frac{c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1},
    w')}{N_n},
\end{align}
where $c(\cdot)$ is the number of occurrences of the given $n$-gram in the
training corpus, and $N_n$ is the number of all $n$-grams in the training
corpus.

Now let's plug Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_expand} into
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_prob}--\eqref{eq:n_gram_marginal}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:n_gram_mle}
    p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = \frac{
        \cancel{\frac{1}{N_n}}
        c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k)}
    {
        \cancel{\frac{1}{N_n}} \sum_{w' \in V} c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1},
    w')
}
\end{align}

\subsection{Smoothing and Back-Off}

{\em Note that I am missing many references this section, as I am writing this
    on my travel. I will fill in missing references once I'm back from my
travel.}

The biggest issue of having an $n$-gram that never occurs in the training corpus
is that any sentence containing the $n$-gram will be given a zero probability
regardless of how likely all the other $n$-grams are. Let us continue with the
example of ``I like llama''. With an $n$-gram language model built using all the
books in Google Books, the following, totally valid sentence\footnote{
    This is not strictly true, as I should put ``a'' in front of the llama.
}
will be given a
zero probability:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item ``I like llama which is a domesticated South American
        camelid.\footnote{
            The description of a llama taken from Wikipedia:
            \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama}
        }
\end{itemize}
Why is this so? Because the probability of this sentence is given as a product
of all possible trigrams:
\begin{align*}
    p(&\text{``I'', ``like'', ``llama'', ``which'', ``is'', ``a'',
        ``domesticated'', ``South'',
    ``American'', ``camelid''}) \\
    =& p(\text{``I''}) p(\text{``like''}|\text{``I''})
    \underbrace{p(\text{``llama''}|\text{``I''}, \text{``like''})}_{=0} \cdots
    p(\text{``camelid''}|\text{``South''}, \text{``American''}) \\
    =& 0
\end{align*}

One may mistakenly believe that we can simply increase the size of corpus
(collecting even more data) to avoid this issue. However, remember that ``{\it
data sparsity is almost always an issue in statistical modeling}''
\cite{chen1996empirical}, which means that more data call for better statistical
models with often more parameters leading to the issue of data sparsity.

One way to alleviate this problem is to assign a small probability to all {\em
unseen} $n$-grams. At least, in this case, we will assign some small, non-zero
probability to any sentence, thereby avoiding a valid, but zero-probability
sentence under the $n$-gram language model. One simplest implementation of this
approach is to assume that each and every $n$-gram occurs at least $\alpha$
times and any occurrence in the training corpus is in addition to this
background occurrence. 

In this case, the estimate of an $n$-gram becomes
\begin{align*}
    p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) =&
    \frac{\alpha + c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w_k)}{\sum_{w' \in V} (\alpha
    + c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w'))} 
    \\
    =&
    \frac{\alpha + c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w_k)}{\alpha |V| + \sum_{w' \in V}
    c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w')},
\end{align*}
where $c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w_k)$ is the number of occurrences of the
given $n$-gram in the training corpus. $c(w_{k-n}, w_{k-n+1}, \ldots, w')$ is
the number of occurrences of the given $n$-gram if the last word $w_k$ is
substituted with a word $w'$ from the vocabulary $V$. $\alpha$ is often set to
be a scalar such that $0 < \alpha \leq 1$. See the difference from the original
estimate in Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_mle}.

It is quite easy to see that this is a quite horrible estimator: how does it
make sense to say that every unseen $n$-gram occurs with the same frequency?
Also, knowing that this is a horrible approach, what can we do about this?

One possibility is to smooth the $n$-gram probability by interpolating between
the estimate of the $n$-gram probability in Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_mle} and the
estimate of the $(n-1)$-gram probability. This can written down as
\begin{align}
    p^S(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = &
    \lambda(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) 
    \nonumber \\
    \label{eq:n_gram_smooth}
    & + (1 - \lambda(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})) p^S(w_k | w_{k-n+1}, \ldots,
    w_{k-1}).
\end{align}
This implies that the $n$-gram (smoothed) probability is computed recursively by
the lower-order $n$-gram probabilities. This is clearly an effective strategy,
considering that falling off to the lower-order $n$-grams contains at least some
information of the original $n$-gram, unlike the previous approach of adding a
scalar $\alpha$ to every possible $n$-gram.

Now a big question here is how the interpolation coefficient $\lambda$ is
computed. The simplest approach we can think of is to fit it to the data as
well. However, the situation is not that easy, as using the same training
corpus, which was used to estimate $p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})$ according
to Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_mle}, will lead to a degenerate case. What is this
degenerate case? If the same corpus is used to fit both the non-smoothed
$n$-gram probability and $\lambda$'s, the optimal solution is to simply set all
$\lambda$'s to $1$, as that will assign the high probabilities to all the
$n$-grams. Therefore, one needs to use a separate corpus to fit $\lambda$'s.

More generally, we may rewrite Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_smooth} as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:n_gram_smoothing_general}
    p^S(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = \left\{ 
        \begin{array}{l}
            \alpha(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}), \text{ if } c(w_{k-n},
            \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k) > 0 \\
            \gamma(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) p^S(w_{k-1}|w_{k-n}, \ldots,
            w_{k-2}), \text{ otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align}
following the notation introduced in \cite{kneser1995improved}. Specific choices
of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ lead to a number of different smoothing techniques. For
an extensive list of these smoothing techniques, see \cite{chen1996empirical}.

Before ending this section on smoothing techniques for $n$-gram language
modeling, let me briefly describe one of the most widely used smoothing
technique, called the modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (KN smoothing), described in
\cite{chen1996empirical}. This modified KN smoothing is efficiently implemented
in the open-source software package called KenLM~\cite{Heafield-estimate}.

First, let us define some quantities. We will use $n_k$ to denote the total
number of $n$-grams that occur exactly $k$ times in the training corpus. With
this, we define the following so-called discounting factors:
\begin{align*}
    Y =& \frac{n_1}{n_1 + 2 n_2} \\
    D_1 =& 1 - 2 Y \frac{n_2}{n_1} \\
    D_2 =& 2 - 3 Y \frac{n_3}{n_2} \\
    D_{3+} =& 3 - 4 Y \frac{n_4}{n_3}.
\end{align*}
Also, let us define the following quantities describing the number of all
possible words following a given $n$-gram with a specified frequency $l$:
\begin{align*}
    N_l(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = |\{ c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k) = l \}|
\end{align*}

The modified KN smoothing then defines $\alpha$ in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:n_gram_smoothing_general} to be
\begin{align*}
    \alpha(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) =
    \frac{
        c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k) - D(c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w_k))
    }{
        \sum_{w' \in V} c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w')
    },
\end{align*}
where $D$ is
\begin{align*}
    D(c) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            0,&\text{ if }c=0 \\
            D_1,&\text{ if }c=1 \\
            D_2,&\text{ if }c=2 \\
            D_{3+},&\text{ if }c\geq 3 \\
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}
And, $\gamma$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \gamma(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})  = 
    \frac{
        D_1 N_1(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) 
        + D_2 N_2(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})
        + D_{3+} N_{3+}(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1})
    }{
        \sum_{w' \in V} c(w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}, w')
    }.
\end{align*}

For details on how this modified KN smoothing has been designed, see
\cite{chen1996empirical}.

\subsection{Lack of Generalization}

Although $n$-gram language modelling works like a charm in many cases. This is
still not totally satisfactory, because of the lack of {\em generalization}.
What do I mean by {\em generalization} here?

Consider an example where three trigrams\footnote{
    Is ``trigram'' a proper term? Certainly not, but it is widely accepted by
    the whole community of natural language processing researchers. Here's an
    interesting discussion on how $n$-grams should be referred to as, from
    \cite{manning1999foundations}: ``{\it 
        these
        alternatives are usually referred to as a bigram, a trigram, and a
        four-gram model, respectively. Revealing this will surely be enough to
        cause any Classicists who are reading this book to stop, and to leave
        the field to uneducated engineering sorts ... with the declining levels
        of education in recent decades ... some people do make an attempt at
        appearing educated by saying quadgram
    }'' 
} were observed from a training corpus: ``chases a cat'', ``chases a dog'' and
``chases a rabbit''. There is a clear pattern here. The pattern is that it is
highly likely that ``chases a'' will be followed by an animal. 

How do we know this? This is a trivial example of humans' generalization
ability. We have noticed a higher-level concept, in this case an animal, from
observing words such as ``cat'', ``dog'' and ``rabbit'', and based on this
concept, we generalize this knowledge (that ``chases a'' is followed by an
animal) to unseen trigrams in the form of ``chases a [animal]''.

This however does not happen with $n$-gram language model. As an example, let's
consider a trigram ``chases a llama''. Unless this specific trigram occurred
more than once in the training corpus, the conditional probability given by 
$n$-gram language modeling will be zero.\footnote{
    Here we assume that no smoothing or backoff is used. However, even when
    these techniques are used, we cannot be satisfied, since the probability
    assigned to this trigram will be at best reasonable up to the point that the
    $n$-gram language model is giving as high probability as the bigram ``chases
    a''. In other words, we do not get any generalization based on the fact that
    a ``llama'' is an animal similar to a ``cat'', ``dog'' or ``rabbit''.
} This issue is closely related to data sparsity, but the main difference is
that it is not the lack of data, or $n$-grams, but the lack of world knowledge.
In other words, there {\em exist} relevant $n$-grams in the training corpus, but
$n$-gram language modelling is not able to exploit these.

At this point, it almost seems trivial to address this issue by incorporating
existing knowledge into language modelling. For instance, one can think of using
a dictionary to find the definition of a word in interest (continuing on from
the previous example, the definition of ``llama'') and letting the language
model notice that ``llama'' is a ``{\em a domesticated pack animal of the camel
family found in the Andes, valued for its soft woolly fleece}.'' Based on this,
the language model should figure out that the probability of ``chases a llama''
should be similar to ``chases a cat'', ``chases a dog'' or ``chases a rabbit''
because all ``cat'', ``dog'' and ``rabbit'' are animals according to the
dictionary.

This is however not satisfactory for us. First, those definitions are yet
another natural language text, and letting the model understand it becomes
equivalent to natural language understanding (which is the end-goal of this
whole course!) Second, a dictionary or any human-curated knowledge base is
an inherently limited resource. These are limited in the sense that they are
often static (not changing rapidly to reflect the changes in language use) and
are often too generic, potentially not capturing any domain-specific knowledge. 

In the next section, I will describe an approach purely based on statistics of
natural language that is able to alleviate this lack of generalization.

\section{Neural Language Model}

One thing we notice from $n$-gram language modelling is that this boils down to
computing the conditional distribution of a next word $w_k$ given $n-1$
preceding words $w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}$. In other words, the goal of $n$-gram
language modeling is to find a function that takes as input $n-1$ words and
returns a conditional probability of a next word:
\begin{align*}
    p(w_k | w_{k-n}, \ldots, w_{k-1}) = f_{\TT}^{w_k} (w_{k-n}, \ldots,
    w_{k-1}).
\end{align*}
This is almost exactly what we have learned throughout
Chapters~\ref{chap:function_approx}--\ref{chap:feature_ext}.

First, we should define the input to this language modelling function. Clearly
the input will be a sequence of $n-1$ words, but the question is how each of
these words will be represented. Since our goal is to put the least amount of
prior knowledge, we want to represent each word such that each and every word in
the vocabulary is equi-distant away from the others. One encoding scheme that
achieves this goal is $1$-of-$K$ coding. 

In this $1$-of-$K$ coding scheme, each word $i$ in the vocabulary $V$ is
represented as a binary vector $\vw_i$ whose sum equals $1$. To denote the $i$-th
word with the vector $\vw_i$, we set the $i$-th element of the vector $\vw_i$ to be
$1$ (and consequently all the other elements are set to zero.) Mathematically,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:one_hot_vector}
    \vw_i = [0, 0, \ldots, \underbrace{1}_{\text{$i$-th element}}, \ldots,
    0]^{\top} \in \{0,1\}^{|V|}
\end{align}
This kind of vector is often called a one-hot vector.

It is easy to see that this encoding scheme perfectly fits our goal of having
minimal prior, because
\begin{align*}
    |\vw_i - \vw_j| = \left\{
        \begin{array}{l l}
            1,&\text{ if }i\neq j \\
            0,&\text{ otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \right.
\end{align*}

Now the input to our function is a sequence of $n-1$ such vectors, which I will
denote by $(\vw^1, \vw^2, \ldots, \vw^{n-1})$. As we will use a neural network
as a function approximator here,\footnote{
    Obviously, this does not have to be true, but at the end of the day, it is
    unclear if there is any parametric function approximation other than neural
    networks.
} 
these vectors will be multiplied with a weight matrix $\mE$. After this, we get
a sequence of continuous vectors $(\vp^1, \vp^2, \ldots, \vp^{n-1})$, where
\begin{align*}
    \vp^j = \mE^\top \vw^j
\end{align*}
and $\mE \in \RR^{|V| \times d}$. 

Before continuing to build this function, let us see what it means to multiply
the transpose of a matrix with an one-hot vector from left. Since only one of
the elements of the one-hot vector is non-zero, all the rows of the matrix will
be ignored except for the row corresponding to the index of the non-zero element
of the one-hot vector. This row is multiplied by $1$, which simply gives us the
same row as the result of this whole matrix--vector multiplication. In short,
the multiplication of the transpose of a matrix with an one-hot vector is
equivalent to {\em slicing out a single row from the matrix}.

In other words, let 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:word_emb}
    \mE = \left[ 
        \begin{array}{l}
            \ve_1 \\
            \ve_2 \\
            \vdots \\
            \ve_{|V|}
        \end{array}
    \right],
\end{align}
where $\ve_i \in \RR^d$. Then,
\begin{align*}
    \mE^\top \vw_i = \ve_i.
\end{align*}

This view has two consequences. First, in practice, it will be much more
efficient computationally to implement this multiplication as a simple table
look-up. For instance, in Python with NumPy, do
\begin{verbatim}
    p = E[i,:]
\end{verbatim}
instead of
\begin{verbatim}
    p = numpy.dot(E.T, w_i)
\end{verbatim}

Second, from this perspective, we can see each row of the matrix $\mE$ as a
continuous-space representation of a corresponding word. $\ve_i$ will be a
vector representation of the $i$-th word in the vocabulary $V$. This
representation is often called a {\it word embedding} and should reflect the
underlying meaning of the word. We will discuss this further shortly.

Closely following \cite{bengio2006neural}, we will simply concatenate the
continuous-space representations of the input words such that
\begin{align*}
    \vp = \left[ \vp^1; \vp^2; \ldots; \vp^{n-1}\right]^\top
\end{align*}
This vector $\vp$ is a representation of $n-1$ input words in a continuous
vector space and often referred to as a {\em context vector}.

This context vector is fed through a composition of nonlinear feature extraction
layers. We can for instance apply the simple transformation layer from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:layer} such that
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:nlm_context}
    \vh = \tanh(\mW \vp + \vb),
\end{align}
where $\mW$ and $\vb$ are the parameters. 

Once a set of nonlinear layers has been applied to the context vector, it's time
to compute the output probability distribution. In this case of language
modelling, the distribution outputted by the function is a categorical
distribution. We discussed how we can build a function to return a categorical
distribution already in Sec.~\ref{sec:other_dist}. 

As a recap, a categorical distribution defines a probability of one event
happening among $K$ discrete events. The probability of the $k$-th event
happening is often denoted as $\mu_k$, and
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^K \mu_k = 1.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the function needs to return a $K$-dimensional vector $[\mu_1,\mu_2,
\ldots, \mu_K ]$. In this case of language modelling, $K=|V|$ and $\mu_i$
corresponds to the probability of the $i$-th word in the vocabulary for the next
word.

As discussed earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:other_dist}, we can use softmax to compute
each of those output probabilities:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:nlm_softmax}
    p(w_n = k | w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{n-1}) = \mu_k = \frac{\exp(\vu_k^\top \vh +
    c_k)}{\sum_{k'=1}^{|V|} \exp(\vu_{k'}^\top \vh + c_{k'})},
\end{align}
where $\vu_k \in \RR^{\dim(\vh)}$. 

This whole function is called a neural language model.  See
Fig.~\ref{fig:nlm}~(a)
for the graphical illustration of neural language model.

\subsection{How does Neural Language Model Generalize to Unseen $n$-Grams? --
Distributional Hypothesis}

Now that we have described neural language model, let us take a look into what
happens inside. Especially, we will focus on how the model generalizes to unseen
$n$-grams.

The previously described neural language model can be thought of as a composite
of two function ($g \circ f$). The first stage $f$ projects a sequence of
context words, or preceding $n-1$ words to a continuous vector space:
\begin{align*}
    f: \left\{ 0, 1\right\}^{|V| \times n-1} \to \RR^d
\end{align*}
We will call the resulting vector $\vh$ a {\em context vector}.
The second stage $g$ maps this continuous vector $\vh$ to the target word
probability, by applying affine transformation to the vector $\vh$ followed by
softmax normalization. 

Let us look more closely at what $g$ does in Eq.~\eqref{eq:nlm_softmax}. If we
ignore the effect of the bias $c_k$ for now, we can clearly see that the
probability of the $k$-th word in the vocabulary is large when the output vector
$\vu_k$ (or the $k$-th row of the output matrix $\mU$) is well aligned with the
context vector $\vh$. In other words, the probability of the next word being the
$k$-th word in the vocabulary is roughly proportional to the inner product
between the context vector $\vh$ and the corresponding target word vector
$\vu_k$.

Now note that the dot product is a linear function. Given a fixed target word
vector $\vu_k$, the ordering of three context vectors based on the mutual
distances is preserved even after multiplying each of them with $\vu_k$. This is
easy to check by observing that
\begin{align*}
    \| \vu_k^\top \vh_i - \vu_k^\top \vh_j \|^2 = \underbrace{\vu_k^\top
    \vu_k}_{=\text{constant}} \| \vh_i -
    \vh_j \|^2,
\end{align*}
meaning that the distance after the dot product with $\vu_k$ is simply elongated
by the norm of $\vu_k$.

What does this mean? This means that the neural language model must project
$(n-1)$-grams that are followed by the same word to nearby points in the context
vector space, while keeping the other $n$-grams away from that neighbourhood.
This is necessary in order to give a similar probability to the same word. If
two $(n-1)$-grams, which are followed by the same word in the training corpus,
are projected to far away points in the context vector space, it naturally
follows from this argument that the probability over the next word will differ
substantially, resulting in a bad language model.

Let us consider an extreme example, where we do bigram modeling with the
training corpus comprising only three sentences:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item There are {\bf three teams} left for the qualification.
    \item {\bf four teams} have passed the first round.
    \item {\bf four groups} are playing in the field.
\end{itemize}
We will focus on the bold-faced phrases; ``three teams'', ``four teams'' and
``four group''. The first word of each of these bigrams is a context word, and
neural language model is asked to compute the probability of the word following
the context word.

It is important to notice that neural language model {\em must} project
``three'' and ``four'' to nearby points in the context space (see
Eq.~\eqref{eq:nlm_context}.) This is because the context vectors from these two
words need to give a similar probability to the word ``teams''. This naturally
follows from our discussion earlier on how dot product preserves the ordering in
the space. And, from these two context vectors (which are close to each other),
the model assigns similar probabilities to ``teams'' and ``groups'', because
they occur in the training corpus. In other words, the target word vector
$\vu_{\text{teams}}$ and $\vu_{\text{groups}}$ will also be similar to each
other, because otherwise the probability of ``teams'' given ``four''
($p(\text{teams} | \text{four})$) and
``groups'' given ``four'' ($p(\text{groups} | \text{four})$) will be very
different despite the fact that they occurred equally likely in the training
corpus.

Now, let's assume the case where we use the neural language model trained on
this tiny training corpus to assign a probability to an unseen bigram ``three
groups''. The neural language model will project the context word ``three'' to a
point in the context space close to the point of ``four''. From this context
vector, the neural language model will {\em have to} assign a high probability
to the word ``groups'', because the context vector $\vh_{\text{three}}$ and the
target word vector $\vu_{\text{groups}}$ well align. Thereby, even without ever
seeing the bigram ``three groups'', the neural language model can assign a
reasonable probability. See Fig.~\ref{fig:nlm}~(b) for graphical
illustration.

What this example shows is that neural language model automatically learns the
similarity among different context words (via context vectors $\vh$), and also among
different target words (via target word vectors $\vu_k$), by exploiting {\em
co-occurrences} of words. In this example, the neural language model learned
that ``four'' and ``three'' are similar from the fact that both of them occur
together with ``teams''. Similarly, in the target side, the neural language
model was able to capture the similarity between ``teams'' and ``groups'' by
noticing that they both follow a common word ``four''.

This is a clear, real-world demonstration of the so-called distributional
hypothesis. Distributional hypothesis states that ``words which are similar in
meaning appear in similar distributional contexts'' \cite{firth1957}. By
observing which words a given word co-occurs together, it is possible to peek
into the word's underlying meaning. Of course, this is only a partial
picture\footnote{
    We will discuss why this is only a partial picture later on.
}
into the underlying meaning of each word, or as a matter of fact a phrase, but
surely still a very interesting property that is being naturally exploited by
neural language model.

In neural language model, the most direct way to observe the effect of this
distributional hypothesis/structure is to investigate the first layer's weight
matrix $\mE$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:word_emb}. This weight matrix can be considered as
a set of dense vectors of the words in the input vocabulary $\left\{ \ve_1,
\ve_2, \ldots, \ve_{|V|}\right\}$, and any visualization technique, such as
principal component analysis (PCA) or t-SNE~\cite{VanDerMaaten08}, can be used
to project each high-dimensional word vector into a lower-dimensional space
(often 2-D or 3-D). 

This input weight matrix, or oft-called a word embedding matrix, has been found
to have an interesting use case.

\subsection{Continuous Bag-of-Words Language Model: Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
Approach}

This is about time someone asks a question why we are only considering the {\em
preceding} words when doing language modelling. Is it a good assumption that the
conditional distribution over a word is only dependent on preceding words? 

In fact, we do not have to do so. We can certainly model a natural language
sentence such that each word in a sentence is conditioned on $2n$ surrounding
words ($n$ words to the left and $n$ words to the right.) In this case, we get a
{\em Markov random field (MRF) language model}~\cite{jernite2015fast}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mrflm.pdf}
    \caption{An example Markov random field language model (MRF-LM) with the
    order $n=1$.}
    \label{fig:mrf_lm}
\end{figure}

In a Markov random field (MRF) language model (MRF-LM), we say each word in a
given sentence is a random variable $w_i$. We connect each word with its $2n$
surrounding words with {\em undirected} edges, and these edges represent the
conditional dependency structure of the whole MRF-LM. An example of an MRF-LM
with $n=1$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mrf_lm}.

A probability over a Markov random field is defined as a product of clique
potentials. A potential is defined for each clique as a positive function whose
input is the values of the random variables in the clique. In the case of
MRF-LM, we will assign $1$ as a potential to every clique except for cliques of
two random variables (in other words, we only use pairwise potentials only.) The
pairwise potential between the words $i$ and $j$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \phi(\vw^i, \vw^j) = \exp\left( (\mE^\top \vw^{i})^\top  \mE^\top \vw^j\right) = 
    \exp\left( \ve_{w^i}^\top \ve_{w^j} \right),
\end{align*}
where $\mE$ is from Eq.~\eqref{eq:word_emb}, and $\vw^i$ is the one-hot
vector of the $i$-th word. One must note that this is one possible
implementation of the pairwise potential, and there may be other possibilities,
such as to replace the dot product between the word vectors ($\ve_{w_i}^\top
\ve_{w_j}$) with a deeper network.

With this pairwise potential, the probability over the whole sentence is defined
as
\begin{align*}
    p(w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_T) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{t=1}^{T-n} \prod_{j=t}^{t+n}
    \phi(\vw^t, \vw^j) = \frac{1}{Z} \exp\left( 
        \sum_{t=1}^{T-n} \ve_{w^t}^\top \ve_{w^j}
    \right),
\end{align*}
where $Z$ is the normalization constant. This normalization constant makes the
product of the potentials to be a probability and often is at the core of
computational intractability in Markov random fields.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mrflm_mblanket.pdf}
    \caption{Gray nodes indicate the 
    Markov blank of the fourth word.}
    \label{fig:mrf_lm_mblanket}
\end{figure}

Although compute the full sentence probability is intractable in this MRF-LM, it
is quite straightforward to compute the conditional probability of each word
$w^i$ given all the other words. When computing the conditional probability, we
must first notice that the conditional probability of $w^i$ {\em only} depends
on the values of other words included in its {\em Markov blanket.} In the case
of Markov random fields, the Markov blanket of a random variable is defined as a
set of all {\em immediate neighbours}, and it implies that the conditional
probability of $w^i$ is dependent only on $n$ preceding words and the $n$
following words. See Fig.~\ref{fig:mrf_lm_mblanket} for an example.

Keeping this in mind, we can easily see that
\begin{align*}
    p(w^i|w^{i-n}, \ldots, w^{i-1}, w^{i+1}, \ldots, w^{i+n})
    = \frac{1}{Z'} \exp\left(\ve_{w^i}^\top \left( 
            \sum_{k=1}^n 
            \ve_{w^{i-k}}
            +
            \sum_{k=1}^n 
            \ve_{w^{i+k}}
    \right)\right),
\end{align*}
where $Z'$ is a normalization constant computed by
\begin{align*}
    Z' = \sum_{v \in V} \exp\left( \ve_v^\top \left( 
            \sum_{k=1}^n 
            \ve_{w^{i-k}}
            +
            \sum_{k=1}^n 
            \ve_{w^{i+k}}
    \right)\right).
\end{align*}

Do you see a stark similarity to neural language model we discussed earlier?
This conditional probability is a shallow neural network with a single {\em
linear} hidden layer whose input are the context words ($n$ preceding and $n$
following words) and the output is the conditional distribution of the center
word $w_i$. We will talk about this shortly in more depth.

Now we know that it is often difficult to compute the full sentence probability
$p(w^1, \ldots, w^T)$ due to the intractable normalization constant $Z$. We
however know how to compute the conditional probabilities (for all words) quite
tractably. The former fact implies that it is perhaps not the best idea to
maximize log-likelihood to train this model.\footnote{
    However this is not to say maximum likelihood in this case is impossible.
    There are different ways to approximate the full sentence probability under
    this model. See \cite{jernite2015fast} for one such approach.
} The latter however sheds a bit of light, because we can train a model to
maximize pseudo-likelihood \cite{besag1975statistical} instead.\footnote{
    See the note by Amir Globerson (later modified by David Sontag) available at
    \url{http://cs.nyu.edu/~dsontag/courses/inference14/slides/pseudolikelihood_notes.pdf}.
}

Pseudo-likelihood of the MRF-LM is defined as
\begin{align*}
    \PL = \prod_{i=1}^T p(w^i | w^{i-n}, \ldots, w^{i-1}, w^{i+1}, \ldots,
    w^{i+n}).
\end{align*}
Maximizing this pseudo-likelihood is equivalent to training a neural network
which approximates each conditional distribution $p(w^i | w^{i-n}, \ldots,
w^{i-1}, w^{i+1}, \ldots, w^{i+n})$ to give a higher probability to the
ground-truth center word in the training corpus.
